    "content": "7 steps to discover your company values\nDebra Corey\nJan 15, 2020\n4 min read\nWe all have company values, right? But are we absolutely sure that our values are actually ‘right’? Are they doing what we need them to do, which is to shape and guide the behaviors and actions of our employees, having them truly help our companies succeed?\nWell according to a study by Gallup, the majority of companies don’t have the ‘right’ values. With only 27 percent of employees believing in them and only 23 percent using them as they go about their work, something isn’t right! And we can’t blame our employees, as it’s down to us to have values that our employees can believe in, and then use them (or as I say, ‘play with them’) so that they in turn believe in and use (play with them) time and time again.\nSo what can you do to ensure you have the ‘right’ values? Here are seven steps I share in my book “Bringing Your Values Out to Play” which can help you discover whether you have the right values in place (or to discover them for the first time):\nStep 1: Start planning\nThe first step is all about planning, which involves taking a step back and thinking through exactly how you’ll get things done. This is important because it forces you to think things through before you begin your discovery journey, making sure that once you begin you don’t have to turn around or start over because you’ve forgotten or have gotten something wrong. This includes determining who should join you on the journey (e.g. do you invite all your employees, a select group, or just your leaders?) and when is the best time to go on this journey.\nStep 2: Stick them on the walls\nThis is where the discovery, and the fun begins, for in this step you will physically or figuratively put all of your ideas for values up on the walls. You can do this in many ways, whether it’s conducting surveys, holding focus groups, or a combination of both (my personal preference).\nBut as fun as this step is, I know from experience that at first it may seem like an ominous task, as you don’t know where to begin or/or how to get this important information. The key is to be absolutely being clear as to what you are looking for, since as the expression goes, “garbage in, garbage out”.\nStep 3: Invite them to the table\nIf step two is where the fun begins, step three is where the hard work begins. And that’s because at the end of step two you have a huge, if slightly unmanageable, list of values up on the wall.\nBut that’s fine, for this step involves turning chaos into a masterpiece by being clear that the purpose and desired outcome is to end up with a list of values that deserve a seat at the table. And like a table, there are only so many seats around it, so you’ll need to have those difficult (but lively) discussions in order to decide which ones are and which ones are not seat worthy.\nStep 4: Test them out\nNow that you have a list of what could be your values, it’s time to test them out. During this step you’ll need to throw the values you’ve come up with in the previous step up against the wall, a different one this time, seeing if they “stick” by checking if and how they resonate with your workforce and leaders.\nStep 5: Select the winners\nIt’s now time to select your winners, those values that have safely made it through the previous four steps, showing that they have what it takes to win the competition. This also includes deciding how many values you want and if/how they will work together as a values set.\nAccording to research conducted for my book, “Bringing Your Values Out to Play”, the most common number of values are five (37.5%), four (21%) and three (18.5%).\nStep 6: Define your values with behaviors\nThis step is where you take your values to the next level, giving them clarity, depth, and what I like to think of as a personality and a voice, or what we commonly call behaviors. This is so important, for if you want your employees to play with your values you need to give them the ‘rules of the game’, letting them know exactly what they mean in action. Don’t leave it to chance - it’s too important.\nStep 7 - Set them free\nThere’s a quote that says, “If you love someone, set them free. If they come back they’re yours; if they don’t they never were.” I choose this quote because I believe that’s exactly the goal of setting your values free, having them embraced and believed in so much that they come back to you time and time again in the actions and decisions made by your employees.\nThis is done through ‘bringing them out to play’ time and time again as you communicate and engage with your employees. In my book I share over 60 examples of how companies such as Zappos, WD-40, DaVita and Radio Flyer are doing this in their hiring, onboarding, recognition and performance management, putting their own unique and playful spin on it. It’s up to you to decide how you’ll play with your values, the key is to get out there and do it!\nSo in ending let me challenge you to use these steps to help you discover your values, pushing yourself to have the right values for your business, and not to settle for anything less. All the best, and have a blast playing with your values!\nThis blog was originally posted on\nhppy\n.\nCompany Values",

    "content": "3 ways to help employees understand what your values REALLY mean\nDebra Corey\nJun 20, 2023\n3 min read\nHave you ever bought a fantastic new gadget or tool that says it’s going to help you do wonderful things, and it ends up sitting on a shelf gathering dust doing absolutely nothing?\nUnfortunately this is exactly what is happening in many companies when it comes to their company values, with them sitting on the shelf because although employees may know what they are, being able to recite them, often they don’t fully know what they mean.\nAnd if they don’t know what they mean, how will they ever know why, when and how to use them?\n“Values are tools that need to be used by your employees each and every day to help you achieve your company's mission, and create the right culture for your people and your business.”\nIn this blog I’d like to share three approaches I use when running values workshops, using them to get employees talking about and understanding what their values truly mean.\n1. Make them relatable\nOne way to help employees understand the meaning of your values is make them relatable, talking in language and in a way that will resonate with them, having them jump off the page as the expression goes. There is no one way to do this, the key is coming up with an approach that will get employees talking about your values, relating them to your business and culture.\nTo illustrate this point, let me share what we did at furniture company OKA when we ran a values workshop. We started by putting employees into groups, and gave them each one of their values. Next, we gave each group a set of cards having images of some of their beautiful products, asking them to decorate a room to align with the value using these cards. By doing this employees, employees related to meaning of the values to the company, their products and to themselves in a much more meaningful way.\n2. Make them personal\nAnother way is to help employees understand what each value means to them personally. This is important because often employees cannot make this connection on their own, thinking that the value may relate and be important to others, but not to them.\nThe approach I use here is to have them discuss what each value means in three ways - to the company, to the team and to me personally. Here’s an example of this using the value of ‘focusing on the customer.’\nWhat does the value mean to the\ncompany\n? For example, why is it important for the company to focus on the customer, and how do we do that?\nWhat does the value mean to my\nteam\n? For example, if I’m in the payroll team, who are our customers and how can I focus on them?\nWhat does the value mean to\nme personally\n? For example, if I’m a payroll clerk, who are my customers and how can I focus on them?\n3. Show both sides\nOne last way is to show both sides of your values and behaviors, showing the “flip side.” By doing this upfront, you’re helping your employees understand what it looks like when they aren’t living the value, and thus what actions and behaviors don’t align with those that are expected of them.\nIn my book,\nBringing Your Values Out to Play\n, I share an example of this from a company in the U.S. called C Space. For their value “do what scares you” they break it out as follows:\nWhat it looks like when it works:\nTrying\nnew things even though they might lead to failure.\nSupporting\nothers to get out of their comfort zones.\nEmbracing\nopportunities for personal growth.\nWhat it looks like when it doesn’t work:\nLiving\noutside of your comfort zone, all the time.\nForging\non alone when you need support.\nAssuming\nthat if you don’t find something scary, nobody else will.\nIn your values workshop you can do this by breaking employees into groups and having them discuss and list both sides for each of their values.\nI hope you’ve found these three approaches helpful. They can be used when you launch or re-launch your values, helping you ensure your company values, your tools, are not left on the shelf.\nIf you'd like to chat about running a values workshop, either on your own or with my support, please\ncontact me\n, I'd love to help.\nTags:\nCompany values\nCompany Values",

    "content": "5 tips for successfully riding the workplace rollercoaster\nDebra Corey\nSep 28, 2022\n4 min read\nListening to the news today, I chuckled as the reporter attempted to make sense of the latest changes, trying to not only explain them, but predict what would come next. Good on him, but if we’ve learned anything over the last few years, it’s that the only thing we can predict is that change will continue to happen!\nAnd with all this change, life and the workplace in general is feeling more and more like a rollercoaster. There are ups, downs and lots of twisty windy turns that we encounter as we move from one challenge to another. Some are ones we’ve seen or have dealt with in the past, and others are like the rollercoasters that catapult you into darkness, not knowing where you are and how to feel and act.\nWith this in mind, I thought it would be helpful to share some tips to help you deal with this change. They come from the insights and lessons I’ve learned throughout my over 20 years as an HR leader, and riding my fair share of rollercoasters.\n1. Understand the change\nThis first tip is an obvious one, which is to understand the change. Not only what it means, but the impact it can and may have on your business and your people. Look at it in many dimensions and perspectives, mapping it out so that it paints a clear picture of the change itself. This is important to do upfront so that this picture can help steer and drive your approach and decisions, giving you the focus and direction you need.\n2. Understand what others are doing\nIt’s also important to gain an understanding of what other companies are doing to handle the change. We all can and should learn from each other, seeing how we’re handling the change for our business and people.  That being said, we need to remember that we are all different, so what may work for one company may not work for us. Use this information as a data point, and then come up with our own solution.\nFor example, in respect to the latest rollercoaster ‘twist’, cost of living challenges, surveys like the one recently released from\nPwC\nare helpful to understand how other businesses are responding. In this situation, they report that more than eight out of ten large businesses are taking action in the form of additional pay increases (50%), providing one-off bonuses (40%) and non-financial interventions (15%).\n3. Understand your people\nThe final element of understanding, and an absolutely critical one, is to understand your people. Listen, really listen, to them, understanding how the changes will impact them in both the short and long term. Key to listening is asking the right questions. A technique I share in one of my books is called ‘The 5 Whys,’ which is all about asking probing questions to help you get to the root of the situation and problem, using this to come up with the solution(s).\nHere’s an example using a real-life situation when my daughter came to me to borrow money. Had I not asked these probing questions I never would have truly understood the situation and taken the correct action (which was to lend her the money and teach her about the evils of some loan companies):\nWhy do you need to borrow money from me? I need to make a payment.\nWhy do you need to make a payment? I need to pay off a loan.\nWhy do you need to pay off a loan? I don’t want to pay any more interest on it.\nWhy don’t you want to pay any more interest on it? Because I just found out that they are charging me an insane amount of interest?\nWhy did you take out this loan? Because I didn’t read the fine print and understand it.\n4. Adopt a flexible approach\nWhen I started out in the workplace, when you put in place an HR programme it was there for many years, set in stone as the expression goes. Gone are these days, for going back to the rollercoaster analogy, something that may work when you’re going up certainly won’t work when you’re plummeting down at full speed. For this reason, you need to adopt a flexible approach to how you design and deliver your HR programmes. Yes, they need to be based on a solid strategy that is driven by your mission and values, but the programmes themselves need to be able to adapt as changes are thrown your way.\nTwo things to think about as you do this are:\nBe open and honest with your people\n- For example, at a previous company when I announced changes in our benefit programmes I told my people upfront that these were to be in place for a year. I didn’t promise them to continue after this time, letting them know that we’d review them and come back with any further changes.\nReview things often\n- Related to the previous point, it’s important to review what you have in place often. This certainly needs to be done as soon as you face new challenges and rollercoaster ‘twists,’ but also on a more regular basis. Using benefits as an example again, no longer can we review our programmes every three or five years, but at least every year.\n5. Get off the rollercoaster from time to time\nRiding a rollercoaster can be a multisensory experience, which is why many of us love them. However, they also have an impact on your body, e.g. your heart rate and blood pressure increases, your brain rattles around in your skull, your inner ear gets confused. For this reason, we don’t go around and around on a rollercoaster ride, but get off and take a break. The same needs to happen when it comes to the workplace rollercoaster, with us walking away from and taking a break from it from time to time. This, as I’m sure you’re aware, helps us be more productive and creative, supporting our overall wellbeing. And as a recent study by Workvivo showed, 98% of HR professionals are burned out, showing that more of us need to take care of ourselves and get off of the rollercoaster.\nI hope you’ve found these five tips useful in helping you as you continue to ride the workplace rollercoaster. Do pull them out and keep them in mind as you hit the highs, lows, twists and turns.\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "Creating a fair and transparent approach to pay\nDebra Corey\nMay 5, 2023\n2 min read\nUpdated:\nJun 20, 2023\nBasecamp produces software that allows a company to bring multiple projects together into one project management tool. Doing this acts as one central source of truth, makes things clear so everyone in the company knows what to do, and is simple and straightforward..\nBasecamp’s pay model has a similar aim of adding clarity and truths to an area that is surrounded in mystery in many companies. According to Jason Fried, co-founder and CEO, “Hiring and training people is not only expensive, but draining. All that energy could go into making better products with people you’ve kept happy for the long term by being fair and transparent about pay and benefits. There’s a fountain of happiness and productivity in working with a stable crew. I’m baffled that such a competitive advantage isn’t more diligently sought.”\nBasecamp’s approach to being fair and transparent with pay has many levels, which is what makes it both unique and effective.\nBase pay\n- Starting with base pay, there are no negotiated salaries or pay raises. Everyone in the same role at the same level is paid the same salary. “Equal work, equal pay,” says Fried. This is true regardless of where employees work in the US, with target pay set at the 90th percentile, or top 10%, of the San Francisco market rates, regardless of their role or where they live.\n“This means everyone has the freedom to pick where they want to live, with no penalty for relocating to a cheaper cost-of-living area. We encourage remote working and have many employees who’ve lived all over while continuing to work for Basecamp,” says Fried.\nBonuses\n- The next area where Basecamp displays its unique approach is with bonuses, which they don't pay, but instead are built into base salaries. “We used to pay bonuses many years ago, but found they were quickly treated as expected salary anyway,” says Fried. Instead, a profit-growth sharing program shares 10% of annual total profit growth with employees, which they believe sets fewer expectations.\nStock options\n- Finally, there are no stock options at Basecamp, but that’s only because they never intend to sell the company. However, being fair and transparent again, they’ve vowed to employees that should they sell the company, they’ll distribute 5% of the proceeds to all current employees.\nThis approach to pay has helped Basecamp maintain an engaged and stable workforce with an average tenure of five years in an industry where companies are lucky to have employees stay for two years. Basecamp’s approach shows engagement comes from fairness and respect, not sky high salaries or millionaire stock options.\nMy tip, or challenge to you, is to look at what you're trying to achieve with your pay programs, and make sure they're helping you achieve this and not getting in your way. For example, do complicated geographic pay structures create fairness or prevent your workforce from moving to where you may need them to work?\nThis blog was taken from my book \"Build it: The Rebel Playbook for Employee Engagement,\" where I share over 40 stories of how rebel companies drive employee engagement.\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "8 ways the world of work is ch-ch-changing\nDebra Corey\nAug 13, 2020\n4 min read\nUpdated:\nMar 2\nOne thing that has been a constant throughout the pandemic has been change. And just when we figure out how to deal with the change from one situation, the world and/or the government throws at us another change. So how do we deal with a world that as written in David Bowie’s song “Changes” is ch-ch-changing?\nThat’s a question I’ve been addressing over the past few months in pretty much every presentation or consult I’ve done. So in this blog, I thought I’d share how I answer this question:\n1) There’s been a desire, a need for connection and community\nFirst, there’s been a desire, a need, for connection and community. With so much uncertainty and fear in the world, we’ve needed to be connected more than ever and relied on our community as well. The creative and great work that companies have done in this space has served as a lifeline to our employees, helping them through the chaos and uncertainty, helping them feel connected and have hope.\n2) We’ve been celebrating the good in the world\nSecond, we’ve been celebrating the good in the world, recognising the good in others. It’s been lovely to see how people are doing this, whether it’s with claps for the NHS, companies creating new pandemic-related recognition eCard (see example below from Reward Gateway) or, in the case of the village where I live, recognition from the cake fairy (here’s a\nblog\nI wrote about her).\n3) There’s been a strong focus on inclusion and being human\nNext, there’s been a strong focus on inclusion and being human. These topics are separate but related, and talk about inclusion and belonging to make everyone in our workforce feel accepted, feel appreciated, and be able to be their true selves, so to be human.\n4) There’s a new found belief that flexible working works\nI can’t talk about change without mentioning flexible working, which, drumroll please . . . . companies are finding actually works. It’s a shame that it’s taken a crisis to prove this, but the good news is that it’s happening and hopefully more companies will continue to offer it in some way post pandemic.\nA survey conducted by Willis Towers Watson found that employees have managed to remain productive in most organisations despite the challenges posed by COVID-19. In fact, only 15% of companies surveyed saying that remote working had had a material negative impact on their business.\n5) Wellbeing is high on everyone’s agenda\nAnother change which will be no surprise to anyone is wellbeing, which I’m sure is high on everyone’s agenda. Whether it’s physical, mental, financial or social, everyone is dealing with the challenges in these areas in one way or another due to the pandemic.\nOne area that has certainly jumped to the top of everyone’s agenda is mental wellbeing, and with data saying that that one in two people in the UK feeling down, depressed or hopeless about the future due to the COVID-19 crisis, putting 41% of the nation’s mental health at risk, you can certainly understand why. The good news is that companies have really risen to the challenge, doing things to support their workforce’s wellbeing. Here’s an example of what Twinkl Educational Publishing with their “It’s OK” wellbeing campaign:\n6) There’s a need for a quicker and more agile approach\nThe next change has to do with speed and flexibility, which I’m sure that each and every one of you has felt. With things changing so quickly, it’s put demands on all of us to be able to quickly come up with and implement programmes. I know that it’s been challenging, but let me stop for a moment to say a huge well done!!\nLet me also say that this will continue, hopefully not as manic, but we will continue to be asked to move quicker and be more flexible, so it’s important for us to make sure that we can do this, looking at how we can streamline our processes, removing things that get in our way and slow us down.\n7) We’ve shown we can do more with less\nAnd it’s not just less time, we’ve also had less money, being asked to deliver more with less of it. But again, many have risen to the occasion, and have made every penny and pound count to connect and support your employees throughout the pandemic. And as much as I’d like to say that once the pandemic is over we’ll all be given tons of money, unfortunately this will not happen, so we need to continue to find ways to strategically use the money we have to meet the changing needs and continue to drive engagement.\n8) There’s a desire and need to leverage technology\nAnd the final one which I look at as an enabler, is technology. For many companies, technology has been invaluable throughout the pandemic, helping them not only reach a dispersed workforce, but do so in an effective and engaging way. We have seen the power of technology, so watch this space on how it continues to change to help meet our changing needs.\nLet me end by asking you a question – How are you going to ch-ch-change what you are doing now and what you do in the future to address them? I look forward to exploring and addressing this with you as the months pass and as we get to the other side of much of this change.

    "content": "Five wellbeing tips for digging deep and carrying on\nDebra Corey\nNov 18, 2022\n4 min read\nLove it or hate it, we’re all familiar with the phrase “Keep Calm and Carry On”. Originating in 1939, in the spring before World War II, it was intended to help Brits\nkeep calm\n- that although we may be suffering, it’s no reason to start acting in a rash and hot-headed manner - and to\ncarry on\n- to look past the bad behavior of our rudest guests, and to go about our daily business as if nothing has happened.\nThis phrase holds true now as we continue to face challenge after challenge, having to calmly carry on as we try to get things done in new ways to overcome these challenges. As I was taking an online spinning class, hearing the motivational words of my instructor, it hit me that maybe a better phrase to help us get through these challenging times is to “Dig Deep and Carry On”, for although keeping calm is helpful, what will help us now even more is to dig deep. And that’s because keeping calm can only go so far, for it doesn’t fundamentally address the problem.\nDigging deep, on the other hand, is about looking inside to see your strengths and potential, and using them to help you reach your goals. It’s about resiliency, and your ability to bounce back after setbacks.\nSo how do we do this? Let me share with you five tips that I took away from my spinning class:\n1. Mix it up\nOne of the reasons I love this particular spinning instructor is that she mixes it up - the music, the exercises, even her words of encouragement. By doing this she keeps me motivated and entertained throughout the entire class, even when I’m exhausted and want to give up.\nThis reminded me of the importance of mixing things up, and trying different things to help motivate and work through the challenges. For me, it’s simple things like working in different parts of the house so that I don’t get bored standing at my desk, or talking to different people to bring diversity into my conversations, or even trying different exercise classes instead of spinning every day.\n2. Prepare to fail\nWhen my instructor said that we should be prepared to fail, I was a bit surprised. Surely she’s here to encourage us to succeed, but what she explained was that we all have good days, where classes would be easy, and bad days, where we’d just want to give up. And, she said, that’s OK, it’s OK to fail from time to time as long as we keep coming back to the class.\nThis is so true, for we all should expect to fail as we face our challenges. We need to dig deep to get through the bad days, accept them, and move on to the next. See failures as opportunities and learning moments, and carry on.\n3. Be proud\nAs words of encouragement, my instructor shouts out ‘be proud’ throughout the class, proud that you’re here fighting and proud of what you’re accomplishing. Sometimes in the midst of a challenge we forget this or take it for granted. But if we’re going to get through these difficult times we need to pause for a moment and be proud of our accomplishments, celebrate our successes, and recognize the differences they have made to ourselves and to others. So a big well done and be proud of yourself to each and every one of you!\n4. Find energy moments\nAnother phrase my instructor shouts out from time to time is to find energy moments, meaning to dig deep to find that burst of energy to help you get up the hill, finish the sprint, or whatever the challenge is. I love this concept as it reminds me that sometimes that no matter how exhausted I am, or how much I want to give up, there is always energy with me. Find the energy, be the energy . . . you get the idea!\n5. Work through the lactic acid build-up\nAnd finally, this tip follows on from the last, and has to do with working through lactic acid build up, which is what happens during strenuous exercise when your body is low in oxygen, causing muscle pain, cramps, and muscular fatigue.\nAs my instructor reminds us, we need to work through the pain, knowing that it is temporary and that we can overcome it. And, by the way, it always surprises me how quickly this happens both on the bike and off, for one minute everything is horrible and the next minute (or possibly day when it comes to life), things have gotten better. If we keep this in mind, understanding that there will be pain, but that we will get past it, it can help us on good days and bad.\nSo there you go, five tips to help you dig deep. Please feel free to add to them, to make them your own, and share them with others so that we can all . . . dig deep and carry on!\nWellbeing",

And according to the research we conducted for our book, we’re not alone:\n99.6% of people said they’ve had one\n.\nBut here’s the uncomfortable flip side: If nearly all of us have\nhad\na bad boss... it also means that nearly all of us have\nbeen\none, too - even if just for a moment.\nBecause for most of us, being a “bad boss” isn’t about malicious intent or toxic traits. We don’t wake up and say, “Today, I’m going to micromanage, avoid feedback, or emotionally vanish from my team.”\nNo, what actually happens is that we unintentionally start wearing what we call\nbad boss personas\n.\nSo instead of denial or defensiveness, let’s do something more powerful - what we encourage in our leadership workshops:\nLet’s notice them. Understand them. And then… do something about them.\n4 Steps to Help You Step Out of a Bad Boss Persona\n1. Name It to Tame It\nWe’re not ones for putting labels on people - after all, it often stifles growth and sparks resistance. That’s why we’ve put together the 10 most common \"bad boss\" personas. The goal? To help leaders recognise when things are slipping and pinpoint what's going wrong. Because let’s face it, if we can’t name the behaviour, we can’t change it.\nAnd just to be clear, these personas aren’t about labeling people; they’re about identifying the behaviours that are causing the issues.\nTip:\nTake a few minutes to familiarise yourself with the personas. What do they look like in action? Which ones do you slip into under pressure? Haven’t taken our free and confidential self-assessment yet?\nHere’s the link.\nWe call this the awareness and acceptance steps - knowing they exist, so you can catch yourself in the act and course correct.\n2. Own It Out Loud\nIt’s one thing to spot a bad boss persona - it’s another to\nown\nit.\nNo\n, we’re not saying you need to wear a name tag or t-shirt that says “Micromanager in Action” (although now that we think about it, that could be fun). But we\nare\nsaying that acknowledging it - out loud - can be a leadership superpower.\nReal-life example:\nI’ve shared before how my alter ego “Debby” would make appearances when I was wearing the Avoider, Hoarder, or Coercer personas. I’d jokingly say to my team, “Debby’s in the office - enter at your own risk.” Far from perfect, but it gave my team language, humour, and most importantly, protection from my unhelpful behaviours while I worked on changing them.\nBottom line: Own your persona. You’ll build trust, create psychological safety, and model humility in action.\n3. Ask: What’s Really Driving It?\nTime to channel your inner detective. When you notice a persona showing up, dig a little deeper:\nWhat’s happening around me that could be causing this? (External triggers)\nWhat am I feeling right now - fear, doubt, pressure, etc? (Internal triggers)\nIs there a pattern here?\nIs this response connected to something my employee said or did?\nWhat’s the story I’m telling myself at this moment?\nBad boss behaviours are often protective strategies - they show up when something deeper is being challenged. Understanding\nwhy\nis the key to shifting behaviour long-term.\n4. Flip It: What to Do Next Time\nMistakes and slip-ups are human. What matters most is what you do next. Once the moment has passed, take a breath, reflect, and ask:\nWhat would my\ngreat boss\nself have done differently?\nWhat skills, support, or mindset would I need to respond better next time?\nWhat’s one practical thing I can do to step\nout\nof this persona and into a more effective leadership behaviour?\nExample:\nIf you wore the Micromanager persona today, ask:\nWhat was I afraid would happen if I let go?\nDid my team need more clarity or support - not more control?\nThen flip it: give clearer direction next time, delegate with confidence, or invest in building the skills your team needs to thrive.\nAnd Finally…\nThis isn’t about perfection. It’s about self-awareness, acceptance, action, honesty, and growth. The best leaders don’t pretend they never wear a bad boss persona - they just make a conscious effort not to wear it for too long. And when they do? They recognise it, own it, and\nstep it up\n.\nWant to know which bad boss persona you wear most often?\nTake our free, confidential self-assessment:\nClick here to get started.\nReady to take it further with your leadership team?\nContact us as we'd love to deliver our innovative and effective leadership workshops to your team.\nLeadership",

    "content": "How River Island celebrates “moments that matter”\nDebra Corey\nFeb 2, 2023\n4 min read\nAt River Island, a British fashion retailer, they “make fashion for real people with real lives, who want to look real good.\" As they say, \"Because life’s a celebration - let’s dress for it.”\nThis attitude and approach can be seen in how they treat their employees, or what they call “Islanders.” They have a focus and commitment to understanding and supporting their diverse workforce, their real people, with campaigns that celebrate and connect to have fun and bring them closer together.\nOne way they do this is through their\nemployee engagement calendar\n, a tool used to celebrate what Glenn Grayson, People Engagement Lead at River Island calls “moments that matter.” The calendar is developed each year, with events selected based on feedback from their Islanders, internal communities, trends, business focuses, and what’s being talked about through social media.\n“When we select these events to go on the calendar it’s quality over quantity, we don’t want to do things for the sake of doing them, they need to be authentic to our people and to our brand,” says Grayson.\nA focus on authenticity is also important in how the campaigns for each event are run. To help them with this, they developed criteria, or what they call the four pillars, with each representing an element of the campaign. Here is a summary of each pillar along with examples from recent campaigns:\n1.  Treat:\nEach campaign includes a treat that is given away, or a chance to win a special treat.\nFor example, during the campaign to celebrate the Lunar New Year there was a Lucky Red Envelope giveaway, with physical ones handed out at head office, and digital envelopes provided for their retail and remote teams. Islanders had the chance to win prizes such as additional annual leave and vouchers.\n2.  Surprise:\nEach campaign has some kind of surprise, something to add excitement and make it feel like a celebration.\nFor example, during the holiday campaign they had a weekly lucky draw where anyone who had been recognised as an ‘Incredible Islander’ could win an experience day or a £100 gift card of their choice by having their name randomly selected and surprised during a live video.\n3.  Challenge:\nEach campaign has a challenge that Islanders can get involved and stuck into, challenging themselves with competitions, activities, and prizes to be won.\nFor example, during the holiday season, they held a digital Supermarket Sweep, where each day Islanders were given the chance to win a shopping trip on the company at a supermarket of their choice! All they had to do was be the first Islander to guess the mystery item in the festive trolley, with clues appearing on their online communications platform.\n4.  Education:\nAnd finally, each campaign has an element of education so that Islanders can learn more about important topics and about each other.\nFor example, during the Lunar New Year campaign they discussed all things associated with the festival including the countries which celebrate it, the traditions, and an insight into the zodiac and the meaning behind each animal.\nAnd during their ‘5 Days of Feel Better’ wellbeing campaign had a different educational focus each day including body positivity, coping through uncertainty, feel good finances and happiness hacks\nAlong with the pillars, there are other criteria that are considered and woven into how they develop and run their campaigns. Here is a summary of a few of them:\nInclusive\n- Campaigns are run in an inclusive way, ensuring that they work not just for Islanders in their head office but in their retail stores and those working remotely. This is so important so that everyone can get involved and feel a part of them.\nHolistic\n- Campaigns are developed in a holistic way, looking at all aspects of the events to ensure they meet the diverse needs of their people. For example, during the holiday campaign it wasn’t just about the festivities, but it included important aspects such as dealing with the mental and financial stresses of the holiday season.\nPractical\n- They select the prizes for each campaign by looking at what their people need and the situations they are in so that they’re practical and useful to them. For example, during the holiday campaign the prizes were supermarket vouchers, something very useful during the entertaining season.\nLet me end by sharing three tips that Glenn was kind enough to share with me to help you as you develop and run your employee engagement calendar:\nKeep it authentic, doing what’s right for your people and your business. The way to do this is to listen to your people, finding out what really matters to them.\nGet different perspectives and opinions to help you design your campaigns. For example, someone on my team is in her early twenties, and she sees things through a completely different lens than I do. As a team we come up with the best ideas and the best campaigns.\nWhatever you do needs to be meaningful. It can be fun, but it needs to be meaningful fun, linking what you do to your values, your business, and as a way to educate and connect your workforce.\nI hope you’ve found this blog  interesting and helpful. All the best in creating your own version of an engagement calendar at your company.\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "6 tips to get your communications noticed\nDebra Corey\nJun 6, 2023\n4 min read\nUpdated:\nJun 20, 2023\nOur employees make judgments within seconds of seeing or hearing it. In fact, according to one study,\nit only takes a tenth of a second to form an impression\n.\nAnd it’s this impression that drives our employees to decide if they will or won’t engage with what we’ve communicated to them. Will they read or listen to it, and will they take the action that is required of them? And it’s not just in the first few words, but throughout it, as employees make a string of judgements over and over again.\nTo help your communications get noticed and to form a positive impression, let me share with you six tips from my book titled “\nEffective HR Communication: A Framework for Communicating HR Programmes with IMPACT\n”:\n1. Think of your employees as consumers\nA consumer is someone who makes a decision as to whether or not to purchase a product or service. Question, isn’t this what employees are? Aren’t they the ones who are ‘purchasing’ what we have to say and what we are asking them to do?\nIf you’re going to interrupt your employee’s day with your communications, you need to make it worthwhile and relevant for them.\nYou need to deliver the WIIFM (what’s in it for me)\n. Remember that your audience is ‘cold’, so currently not engaged with your communications and the topic. Ask yourself, what can I do to ‘defrost’ them, creating content to motivate your employees to complete the ‘purchase’.\n2. Put yourself in your employee’s shoes\nIt’s absolutely key to create your content from your employee’s perspective, putting yourself in their ‘shoes’. Consider what they know (and don’t know) already, what they need to know, and how they would best like to receive this information.\nKeep in mind that your workforce wears many ‘shoes’ due to their diversity, so\ntake the time to fully understand what they want and need\n. Use this to shape your content, and test it throughout the process to ensure you get the right ‘fit’.\n3. Prioritize messages\nLet’s face it, communicating HR concepts and programs can often be difficult, especially in an engaging and concise way. And for this reason, we often find that our employees drop off, often not getting to the end of our content. For this reason we need to prioritize our messages, ranking them in order of importance.\nStart out with the most important message, the ‘if they read nothing else’ part of your content\n. And, create it in a way that assumes your employees will not make it to the next parts of your message, which I often break out into the second and third parts of the message.\nOne way to do this is with the subject or strap line, or what I like to think of as the hook that gets your employees to click or read on. Too often we rush into creating this, but I’ve learned over the years that it’s actually where we need to spend quality time, getting it right from the start.\n4. Use storytelling\nPeople react well to stories, as it makes the content more approachable and brings the concepts to life. It also makes it more memorable, which is certainly a common objective of communication with our employees.\nA study done by two Stanford professors, Gordon Bower and Michael Clark, set out to test the memorability of words embedded in stories versus that of a random list of words. Students were asked to memorise and recall 10 sets of unrelated words. The control group remembered the words in whatever order occurred to them. For the story component, the students constructed stories that contained all the words. When asked to recall these words, the students who constructed stories were able to remember six to seven times as many compared with the random set.\n5. Create breathing space\nThe concept of breathing space is about creating enough space between your words so that employees have enough space and time to breathe. This is important from an HR communications perspective as you want to\ngive your employees the time to absorb what you have presented to them\n.\nYou can do this by breaking up content, e.g. headers, sub-headers, mixing up the format of the content, and creating white space into your design.\nThe importance of this was brought to life recently in the following review posted about one of my books:\n“Due to my dyslexic super power, I often get lost or bored and revert to the audio version. Over the years it's damaged my confidence in picking up a book as the joy could not be found in reading. Your book is so simple to understand, I think it's the line spacing, clear language, boxes and visuals. It was honestly a pleasure!”\n6. Be genuine\nLast, but certainly not least, is to create content that is genuine. If we sound like a corporate machine, putting no personality into our content, we won’t sound genuine and we won’t engage with and gain the trust of our employees.\nYou can do this by\ntelling the truth\n, even when it’s bad news,\nspeaking from the heart\n,\navoiding jargon\n, and\nbeing believable\n.\n“People hear you on the level you speak to them from. Speak from the heart, and they will hear with theirs.”\nMarianne Williamson, US Teacher\nI hope you’ve found these six tips helpful, and can use them going forward to help your communications be noticed by your employees.\nPlease\ncontact me\nif you'd like to discuss how you can create more engaging content, or how to drive employee engagement at your company.\nTags:\nEmployee communication\nCommunication",

    "content": "How organisations are virtually celebrating the festive season during Covid-19\nDebra Corey\nNov 25, 2020\n4 min read\nUpdated:\nJan 31, 2021\nI’m sure you’ve all heard the terms ‘party pooper’, that person who throws gloom over social enjoyment, and ‘killjoy’,, that person who deliberately spoils the enjoyment of others. Well not to point fingers, but . . . . the award for 2020 party pooper and killjoy goes to COVID-19!\nFor COVID-19 has single handedly made it impossible to have end-of-year and holiday celebrations and festivities. But, as the expression goes, “where there’s a will, there’s a way”, and that’s exactly the attitude and approach many companies have adopted during these challenging times. They’ve realised that this year, probably more than other years, their employees need something to improve spirits and bring them together, and they’re planning some wonderful and creative alternatives.\nSpeaking of planning, in my\nprevious blog\nI shared these five tips on what to think about as you plan your activities, and the same is true when planning your events:\n1. Start by asking yourself the question “what am I really trying to do”?\n2. Ask yourself “how do I want my employees to feel”?\n3. Re-think and re-invent how you deliver your objectives.\n4. Deliver in a diverse and inclusive way.\n5. Remember, you don’t have to spend a fortune.\nAnd to give you a bit more help and inspiration, I’m excited to share with you examples of what\neight\ncompanies are planning on doing in their own unique and individual way. The first five are about holiday parties and award ceremonies, and the final\nthree\nare about holiday wellbeing, something equally important to focus on at this time of the year:\nAt\nInvosys\nthey’re holding a virtual Christmas Party/Annual Awards night. Ready-meals and drinks will be delivered to every employee’s home so they can all eat and drink ‘together’.\nThey’ve arranged a great line-up of entertainment throughout, including a DJ to wrap up and energise the celebrations. And regarding the awards, they’ve pre-arranged with the winner’s families to award them to the individual in real-time to make it that much more special for the winner.\nAt\nReward Gateway\nthey’re holding an interactive virtual holiday party. It starts with a welcome gift that employees select when they register, choosing between a variety of drinks, chocolates, a wellbeing pack or a donation to a selected charity.\nThey’ll run four interactive activities to create an interactive experience for everyone, including a quiz, karaoke, charades and recognition. Prizes range from a bag of brussels sprouts to a Fitbit, and everything in between.\nThey’re also having lots of competitions and activities such as a ‘best dressed challenge’, ‘how many baubles in my festive sack’ game, and a ‘spin the wheel’ game where names are randomly selected to perform a challenge and win a prize. The aim is for everyone to get involved and everyone to win a prize, great combination!\nAt\neve Sleep\nthey’ll be bringing the team together in a virtual setting for their holiday party and end-of-year awards. Employees will be sent pizza and mince pie making kits along with a voucher for drinks so that they can cook together and then sit down for a virtual meal.\nFor their awards, as with previous years they’ll be celebrating individuals who have lived and breathed each of their company values, plus they’ve added some lockdown awards including best backdrop, best mishap, and best work-from-home setup.\nAt\nEn Route International\nthey’re holding a virtual ‘Back to the 80’s’ cocktail party. Employees will be sent a ‘party in a box’ that includes 80’s retro accessories, sweets and snacks, ingredients for cocktail making, pre-mixed cocktails/mocktails, a shot glass, midnight munchies, a hangover survival kit and a kazoo to be used during one of the games.\nAnd speaking of games, there will be a variety of activities in-line with the theme such as a virtual disco, a dance competition, and the premier of their annual Xmas video done to this year’s song ‘Club Tropicana’, a popular 80’s hit.\nAt another company, whose name I cannot share as they haven’t announced their plans  to their employees yet, they’ve also moved their end-of-year awards party to a virtual event. The technology they’ll be using will allow them to present on a main stage and then bring winners onto the screen to celebrate their achievements, making it that much more special.\nTo get colleagues excited, they’ve sent invitations to home addresses, and then before the event they’ll receive a fully personalised party pack that includes a small bottle of champagne, chocolates and a programme for the evening. Regarding dress code, I’ve been told that it will most likely be party on the top and pyjamas on the bottom!\nAt the\nMinistry of Justice,\nbesides celebrating the holidays, they’re supporting their employees by running a webinar called ‘Reframing Our Festivals’, which looks at alternative and fun ways to celebrate, and innovative ways to connect with loved ones who you cannot be with physically. This builds on the success of their ‘by staff, for staff’ webinars during lockdown, with the facilitator being someone from their leadership and capability team.\nAt\nTeleperformance\nthey’re also finding ways to give back during the holidays, supporting their employee’s wellbeing by supporting others. An example is their ‘Keep Smiling’ campaign which has the taglines of “working together to keep the nation smiling, helping care homes spread the joy”. Cards were designed by TP employees and family members that have lovely hand drawn images and upbeat messages, and are sent to residents in care homes as well as key workers, delivering them along with treats so that they don’t feel forgotten and, of course, kept smiling.\nThese have been updated with holiday themes, continuing to spread more love and joy during the holiday season.\nAt\nCheckatrade\nthey’re also giving back by holding a ‘Check the Halls’ Christmas Charity Challenge as a way to support the Samaritans during the holiday season. Employees can enter four challenge categories - best dressed tree, best themed tree, best dressed house and worst dressed tree - making a minimum £2 donation.\nAll entries will be shared with staff, who will donate to vote for their favourites to win. The winners will receive a tin of Celebrations – to celebrate their victory.\nSo that’s it for my end-of-year and holiday blogs. I hope they’ve helped and inspired you, and I wish you all a happy and healthy holiday season.\nThis blog was originally posted on\nHR Zone\n.\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "3 lessons on disengagement from an aqua class\nDebra Corey\nFeb 21, 2024\n3 min read\nI always joke with my husband that my moments of inspiration usually happen in the shower. This is where I come with ideas for my books, talks and work that I’m doing with my clients. So it should be no surprise that I had similar moments of inspiration during my aqua class, this time relating to the impact and cost of disengagement.\nLet me begin by saying that I love taking aqua classes. Or at least I did before three women started taking it, ones that spend the entire class chatting amongst themselves and doing as little exercise as possible. I call them the disengaged, for although they are quite engaged with their chatter, they are disengaged with the main reason for being there, the class and the exercise.\nAs I was doing my best to ignore them during class this one day it made me think of the impact they have on those around them. And, how this compares to what happens when we have disengaged employees in the workplace. So, here are three lessons I had during this inspirational moment. By the way, I thought this blog was much more constructive than shouting at them across the pool to just shut up!\n1. Disengaged employees take up space\nThe frustrating thing about my aqua class is that the spots fill up in about five minutes. This means that if you don’t go online between 7:00 and 7:05 am the week before the class, you don’t get in. Since most of the people taking the class are retired, this doesn’t seem to cause them challenges, but to me, someone who still works and travels with work, it can indeed be very challenging.\nSo when I saw these three women all I could think of was - what a waste of space! They are taking spaces away from people like me who want to be there, but quite often can’t get a space.\nThe same is true in the workplace, where we only have a limited number of spaces (jobs). For this reason, my question to you is, do you have the right people filling these spaces? Are there people who don’t want to be there or are there for the wrong reasons that are taking up valuable space?\n2. Disengaged employees get in the way of others\nMoving on, my next frustration about these disengaged people is that they get in the way. Since much of the class we spend moving left to right or front to back, these three women who stand in place and talk do little but get in the way of others. You end up having to go around them or being stuck in one place trying to get the workout you came there to do, thus ruining your experience.\nAgain, the same is true in the workplace. If your disengaged people are standing ‘in place’ they are getting in the way of the experience and success of your other people.\n3. Disengaged employees make others want to leave\nAnd finally, the impact of these disengaged people was that I got very close to quitting the gym. Between the frustration of not being able to get into classes, or when I did, having to bob and weave around them, I had decided to cancel my membership. It was only when I decided that I wasn’t going to let them ruin it for me that I decided to stay.\nThe same can and does happen in the workplace, with people leaving because of the negative impact that disengaged employees have on them. Like me, they may get to the point where they say that enough is enough, and that they don’t want people like this around them ruining their experience.\nLet me end by saying that there was a ray of hope during this class, and that was when our instructor surprised everyone and jokingly splashed water on these women, telling them to break it up. We all held back applause, but did have huge grins on our faces.\nThis is exactly what needs to happen when as a leader we see disengagement in our ‘pool.’ We need to do something to break it up, change it or get them entirely out of your ‘pool.’\nPlease\ncontact me\nwith any questions you have, or for help you may require in designing and delivering your engagement strategy or programs. I'm here to help however I can. All the best!\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "What a onesie has to do with wellbeing\nDebra Corey\nFeb 17, 2021\n4 min read\nUpdated:\nMay 4, 2023\nWhen I saw Dan Fish’s post sharing his new wellbeing initiative, onesies, I was intrigued. How could a onesie be part of a wellbeing strategy? Well leave it to Dan, and Invosys, to find a way to take wellbeing to the next level with this initiative, and to weave it into the other wonderful ways they are supporting the wellbeing of their people.\nIn this blog I’ve asked Dan some questions about wellbeing at Invosys, a company that weaves innovation into their business solutions, and as you’ll see, into their wellbeing strategy and programmes.\nWhy is wellbeing important at your company?\nDan:\nWellbeing has always been a big part of the Invosys philosophy from day one, as our CEO Rob has always said that it’s a foundation of what we are built on - if you want a successful business,it starts with all our employees. To me it’s like an ecosystem, if staff are well looked after and respected by management, in return we should have happy, healthy, engaged and motivated staff who are not just employees, but invested within the company. Everyone knowing and working towards our ‘why’, our mission.\nWhat is your wellbeing strategy?\nDan:\nThe big focus areas of our wellbeing strategy are mental health, financial health, physical health and learning, which is about removing barriers for people to broaden their horizons. We equally focus on all of these, with initiatives supporting each of them in different ways.\nWhat wellbeing initiatives have you been doing?\nDan:\nWe do try and keep our initiatives fresh by not following trends - we like our people to be wowed. Here are a few of them:\nFinancial wellbeing\n– We partner with a financial advisor to offer sessions to our employees to help them understand and manage their finances at different stages of their life.\nHealth insurance\n- We selected a health insurance provider that has a proactive approach to health, offering health incentives to encourage employees to lead healthy lives. The more healthy activities you do, the more rewards you get.\nPersonal interest allowance\n– Each employee is entitled to a grant of £400 each year to learn or develop a skill that may or may not be related to work. We do ask our employees to contribute 30% so that they are invested into it. Lots of people have subsidised driving lessons with this, learnt different languages and some more left field activities including circus skills and pole dancing classes.\nVirtual drinks and team beer/gin/wine tasting\n- In the summer, we enjoyed zoom drinks on a Friday at 4:30, which became a great way to talk about the week while drinking our favourite beverages. Since the further lockdowns have come into place, we’ve moved to more of a team focus with virtual drink tasting sessions done either in teams, or who’s birthday it is in that month, and have gone down really well.\nMental health first aiders\n- At Invosys we previously invested in training a number of mental health first aiders. But because now more than ever it’s important that people are not just aware of mental health, but can also see the signs of when any of our team are struggling and try to help, we’ve just invested in more training for another five members of staff.\nSome extras\n- During the first lockdown, we offered an Amazon incentive to all staff - the choice of a Tablet, Firestick or Smart Speaker along with subscriptions to Amazon Prime (which includes Amazon Prime Video) Amazon Music and Audible (audio books) We wanted to do something to try and alleviate lockdown boredom so that our staff could relax or learn when they weren’t working, and it went down really well.\nAnd the onesie, why did you decide to send out onesies?\nDan:\nWe were trying to come up with a way to make lockdown 3.0 a bit more bearable for our people, and we thought that a onesie would compliment our Amazon offering. What could be better than snuggling up in your cosy onesie after your work day and watching a good movie or listening to a good book? It also shows our employees that we care about them even if we don’t see them every day, and in fact, some wear them during the day as we’ve seen on team calls.\nHave you done anything that hasn’t exactly worked to plan?\nDan:\nDuring lockdown 1.0 we had a focus on daily exercise and we learned that you “can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink.” I think the big lesson here is that as a company we can offer all of these wellbeing programmes and initiatives, but that we shouldn’t try and force people into doing something they don’t want to do - they are there for people to use as they choose. The key is choice and not forcing anything as this can have the opposite effect to actual wellbeing - there is no one size fits all solution.\nI have also learned that if something works, it's not going to work forever. For example, Friday drinks were a novelty that people really enjoyed at first, but numbers dwindled and it felt like it was becoming a chore for people. So if something stops working or stops having the desired effect, we shouldn’t be afraid to make a change.\nThanks Dan for sharing your story, and for you and James Kilby for having such an innovative and meaningful approach to wellbeing. Keep the ideas and onesies coming!\nWellbeing",

    "content": "4 Traps Tripping up Bosses\nDebra Corey\nApr 16, 2024\n5 min read\nI firmly believe that the majority of bosses do not intentionally set out to be a bad boss. They don’t wake up in the morning, get dressed, eat their breakfast and say to themselves,\n“What can I do today to be a bad boss? What can I do to ruin the lives of my people?”\nAnd yet time after time, person after person, that’s exactly what is happening, with well-intentioned bosses getting it wrong. Instead of being the great boss they want and need to be, they are doing the opposite of what they set out to do. They’re making bad decisions, taking bad actions, and causing bad impacts on\nretention\n(57% of people surveyed said they left their company because of their boss),\ntrust\n(64% of people surveyed said that they’d trust a robot more than they’d trust their boss), and\nemployee engagement\n(managers account for at least 70% of the variance in employee engagement scores) to name a few.\nWhy is this happening? Why do we have so many bad bosses, which according to our survey, 99.6% of people said they’ve had?  One of the main causes is what we call “traps,” things we blindly fall into that trip us up and lead us to these bad behaviours and actions.\nHere are four common traps explored in our book ‘\nBad Bosses Ruin Lives: The Building Blocks for Being a Great Boss\n.’ Along with these, I've shared examples relating to the 10 types of bad bosses we define.\nTrap\n#1\n: Time\nLet’s face it, being a boss is not easy. You're pulled in multiple directions and often have competing demands. For this reason, one of the most common traps bosses fall into that causes them to adopt bad boss traits is time, more specifically, the feeling that there isn’t enough time to act in any other way.\nAn example is the Micromanager boss, someone who is overly involved in their people’s work, constantly controlling and prescribing what and how work is done. They often fall into the time trap as they believe that they don’t have the time to teach or explain things to their people, so manage them at every turn and step or “just do it myself.” In reality, this actually ends up increasing their time demands as their people rely so heavily on them, not being able to do things on their own and being a bottleneck to their people and the business.\nThe Micromanager Boss\nActions to take:\nTo avoid this trap, bosses such as Micromanagers need to challenge themselves to weigh the pros and cons of their actions. Remind themselves that in the short term it may take a bit more time to release the controls, but in the not-so-distant future it will help them reap the benefits of more time.\nTrap\n#2\n: Misguided beliefs\nWhen surveying bosses on which of the 10 types of bad bosses they’ve been, the most common response was the Pretender, someone who puts on a mask so their people don’t know that there’s a problem or issue.\nBosses often act in this way because they fall into the trap of misguided beliefs, believing that this is what their people want and need from them. And because of this, the Pretender boss withholds the truth, gives answers they feel are wanted, and fails to give their people the honesty they need and deserve.\nAn example of this is when feedback is withheld following a difficult situation or when a problem occurs, with the Pretender putting on a mask and acting like nothing is wrong. The problem with this is that it can have a\nsignificant impact on performance, perpetuating bad performance and setting the person up to fail time and time again. In Kim Scott’s book\nRadical Candor\nshe calls this “ruinous empathy,” where you put caring too much above hurting the feelings of your people. And like anything ruinous, it can cause disasters in how your people act and what they can and cannot achieve.\nThe Pretender Boss\nActions to take:\nTo avoid this trap, bosses need to challenge themselves to understand what their people need and don’t need, and base their actions and behaviours on these, and not assumptions.\nTrap\n#3\n: Confusion\nAnother common trap is confusion, often caused when there is confusion between intent (what we intend and believe to be happening) and impact (what is really happening).\nAn example of this is the Coercer boss, someone who uses power in the wrong way in order to control and coerce processes and outcomes. They’re often confused, believing that this use of power is necessary and isn’t causing problems. But because the impact of such actions often leads to fear, their people tend to hide the impact and problems that this can and does create.We talk about this in our book when describing the difference between fear and respect, and how sometimes we mistake and confuse one for the other. And while fear can be one of the most disabling behaviours, stopping your people in their tracks, respect can deliver enormous benefits and returns to your people and your business.\nThe Coercer Boss\nActions to take:\nTo avoid this trap, bosses need to closely look at their impact versus intent, understanding whether what they want and need to happen is actually taking place or is being masked in fear or any other negative emotions.\nTrap\n#4\n: Skills\nNew bad bosses get created because, quite frankly, the role keeps changing, making it harder and harder to be a great boss. Just look around you. Your workforce is different and more diverse than ever with five generations working side by side, the workplace is different with new work arrangements and AI impacting how and where work gets done, and expectations from your business, customers, and people are different as well. Add it all up, and the skills required to be a great boss now are drastically different to those that were required in the past.\nThis leads me to the final trap, which involves assuming that you have the right skills to be a great boss. An example of this is with the Unappreciater boss, someone who doesn’t show their people recognition or gratitude, making them feel unvalued, invisible, and unappreciated for their actions and contributions. I’d like to say that over the years bosses have developed the skills to show appreciation, but it was actually the highest ranked bad boss in our survey, with 81% of people saying that they’ve had this kind of bad boss. This means that the majority of bosses have not yet learned the skills to give meaningful, genuine and timely appreciation to their people. Or as I say in another one of my books, they don’t know how to ‘\nSee it. Say it. Appreciate it!\n,’ delivering the appreciation feeling.\nThe Unappreciater Boss\nActions to take:\nTo avoid this trap, bosses need to be honest with themselves and equip themselves with new skills to tackle their bad boss traits instead of trying to be a great boss using bad boss skills and techniques.\nI hope you’ve found these explanations of traps helpful, and can use them to ensure that you aren’t tripped up by them in your quest to be great!\nIf you’d like to read more on avoiding these traps as well as how to be a great boss, please read our book\nBad Bosses Ruin Lives: The Building Blocks for Being a Great Boss\nor contact us to chat more.\nLeadership",

    "content": "3 reasons why timing is important for pop stars and HR communication!\nDebra Corey\nDec 10, 2018\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nJan 31, 2021\nI have a new understanding and appreciation for the expression ‘timing is everything’ after attending The Jingle Bell Ball last night, a concert in London having a lineup of ten famous pop stars. The final act was Little Mix, a hugely popular girl group, one that was one of the headline acts.\nBut what happened as they performed absolutely surprised me, as little by little people got up and left! How could they leave something they had so looked forward to? Simple, the concert had over run and they needed to get home as they didn’t want to miss the last trains of the night and/or needed to get home for work or school the next morning!\nThis reminded me once again the importance of timing. A lesson I’ve learned many times as an HR professional as I’ve had my own share of ‘walkouts’ when communicating to my audience, my employees.\nHere are three of these lessons:\n1. Look at your competition.\nPerforming right before Little Mix was Jason Derulo, who was absolutely amazing, completely stealing the show. What this meant to Little Mix was that they had to be that much better to get the audience’s attention and support.\nThe same is true with our HR programs and messages, for if we try to launch or communicate them at a time when too much is going on in our business we will also be challenged with getting our employee’s attention.\nIt’s for this reason that when I worked for a retailer, the month of December was off limits for communicating anything unless it was absolutely critical to the business since this was our peak trading season and we needed to focus communication on these messages. So make sure you are aware of and respect your competition.\n2. Find ways to stand out.\nSince Little Mix was the last of ten acts to perform, they needed to find a way to stand out from the others to make it interesting and memorable. If they didn’t, then they would risk blending into the other acts.\nWe have the same challenge with our HR communication, since so much else is going on in the business fighting for the attention of our employees.\nIt’s for this reason that when we launched a new benefit at Reward Gateway we came up with something unique and different with our advent calendar approach, grabbing and keeping the attention of our employees. So find ways to stand out, making absolutely sure that nothing is missed.\n3. Think of the consequences.\nAs I mentioned at the start, Little Mix went on last, and unfortunately was put in a no-win situation as the concert had run late. No matter how good they were, people were still going to leave early as they needed to get home.\nIn HR we likewise need to consider the consequences or impact of other things happening. An example is a mistake I made once when launching a new benefit program immediately after a significant change had been made with a pay program. Although the new benefit was a great one, it had no chance whatsoever to be viewed positively, as employees connected the two changes and thus saw it negatively.\nLuckily I learned my lesson, and the next time positive and negative changes were happening near the same time I linked them together in my messaging. By doing this I was able to explain the why so that employees understood and accepted both of them. By getting in front of the consequences I was able to turn a negative into a positive.\nSo next time you get ready to communicate to your employees, remember that timing is indeed everything, and set your messages up to be the star of the show!\nCommunication",

    "content": "How Cox Automotive have Geared Up their approach to rewards\nDebra Corey\nApr 26, 2023\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nJun 20, 2023\nCox Automotive, the world’s largest automotive services organization, is passionate about providing their customers with the tools and resources they need to thrive in an ever-changing world. As they say on their website, “Automotive A-Z.”\nThe same is true when it comes to their people, offering them competitive and holistic rewards which include benefits, wellbeing and recognition. But as Vikki Gledhill, Senior Director International Total Rewards, found when joining the company, the majority of employees were unaware of what these were. Using a shop analogy, they were on the shelves, but employees weren’t looking at or buying them.\n“We had a portal where information could be found, but it wasn’t engaging, didn’t reflect our culture, and usage by employees was really low as they struggled to find things,” says Gledhill.\nGledhill and the team set off to change this, bringing everything together in a portal that was more user-friendly and aligned with their culture. They named it “Gear Up” to reference the auto industry and also as it could be used in a fun and effective way in their marketing and communication campaigns.\n“We brought everything together under one brand, with one logo, so that it’s instantly recognizable to our employees. It’s been so successful that it’s become a part of our language, e.g. I’m going to gear up my pension, my wellbeing,” says Gledhill.\nTo further educate and raise awareness of their holistic offering through Gear Up, Cox Automotive held roadshows across their 18 UK sites, calling the campaign ‘Shift up a Gear with Gear Up.’\n“Our roadshows gave us an opportunity to get out and about to meet our amazing people on all of our sites, and also promote total rewards, ensuring that our valuable team members are fully aware of everything we offer that is of benefit to them and to ensure they are aware of all the sources of support that are available. Promoting the value of total rewards is more important than ever at the moment as we navigate through current economic challenges,” says Gledhill.\nThe roadshows were extremely successful, with the percentage of Gear Up active users increasing from 60% to 94%. Other positive results were as follows:\n£673,000 was spent through the employee discount benefit, saving employees over £43,000 throughout the year.  This is a 129% increase on 2021 results.\nJust under 5,000 eCards were sent to employees thanking them for their work, wishing them happy birthday or other celebratory events.\n6,400 instant recognition awards, called “Pole Position,” were issued.\n259 Grand Prix recognition nominations were received for work that was done above and beyond.\nThere were 691 visitors to the Wellbeing Centre, with 4,800 page views in total..\nAnother benefit of the roadshows is that the HR team received valuable and constructive feedback, “nuggets of information” as Gledhill explained. For example, they heard from employees who worked out in the yards and had no access to computers, that an offline physical recognition award would work better for them. Because of this, they decided to add physical vouchers to their existing recognition approach, increasing the impact in a more inclusive and effective way.\nBut they haven’t stopped with roadshows, Cox Automotive is finding additional ways to create awareness around Gear Up, and all of its components. One is through additional communication campaigns, ones that signpost a range of things employees can use depending on their situation. Another is by enlisting the help of HR business partners and culture representatives, who can talk up the program on the ground. And next year, instead of roadshows their theme will be ‘Staying in High Gear,’ where they will visit sites again in a more informal way, being there to make sure that employees' questions are answered and feedback continues to flow.\nGledhill is clear that it is vital to keep the momentum going, so Cox will continue with their communication campaigns throughout the year.  Next steps include promotion of Apps, further work on financial resilience, and continuing to promote recognition channels, in particular Gear Up Grand Prix, aligning with our guiding principles and defining and promoting what “good and great” looks like.\nIf you'd like to discuss how to improve engagement with your reward programs through branding and communication, please\ncontact me\n, I'd love to help you.\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "Three steps for discovering (or re-discovering) your company values\nDebra Corey\nJun 30, 2021\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nAug 14, 2023\nCompany values are one of the most powerful tools a company has, guiding and focussing employees to make the\nright decisions\nand take the\nright actions\nfor their business. And for this reason, every company, regardless of industry, size or country, needs to have the “right” company values.\nIn this blog I’ll share with you a three-step process l I developed and map out in detail in my\nDIY Values Toolkit\nto help companies discover their values for the first time or revisit existing ones. The process is called the “\nWTH Approach,”\nand includes these three steps:\nPut your values on the wall\nInvite your values to the table\nBring your values home\n“The journey to discover your true company values involves looking at what you already\nsay\n, what you already\ndo\n, what you already\nbelieve\n, and what you want and need to\nprotect\n.”\n- taken from \"\nBringing Your Values Out to Play\n\"\nStep 1 - Put your values on the wall\nThis step is where you will begin your values discovery process, with the objective being to discover values that should be\nput up on the wall\n, meaning they are the ones that at first glance will help you deliver on your business and people objectives.\nDon’t worry if you have a lot of potential values at the end of this step — it’s normal and will be helpful as you move onto the next step. Also, don’t  get hung up on the specifics of the words right now, as later on in the process the values will be turned into suitable words that are right for your company and your culture.\nPlease note that in my toolkit I include values cards having sample values to help throughout the discovery exercise. If you don’t have the toolkit, you can use post its or something similar to capture your ideas.\nStep 2 - Invite your values to the table\nThis step is where you will refine and prioritize the values into only those that\ndeserve a seat at the table\n. These are ones that you\njust can’t walk away\nfrom as they are so critical to the life, health, and success of your company, and fully align with your objectives.\nHere are a few things to keep in mind during this step:\n\"Permission to play” values.\nSome of the values you have come up with during step 1 may be considered what are called “permission to play” values, which means they are fundamental and essential, minimum standards of behavior, but don’t necessarily help differentiate you or help you achieve your objectives. Think of them like the air that you breathe, they’re important but they’re a given in how you live.\nDon’t worry about the exact words/wording.\nMake the point again that you shouldn't get hung up on the words during this step, but the intent of the words.\nBe selective.\nBe selective here, keeping in mind that there are only so many seats at the table, make the ones that you select count.\nStep 3 - Bring your values home\nThis final step is where you will\nbring home\nthe values that have been discovered up to this point, selecting your\nwinning\nvalues and then putting these into your own words, infusing your own culture, personality, and tone of voice.\nThere are two parts to this step: 1.\nSelecting your winners\n, those that you decide should be your final values and 2.\nMaking them your own\n, which is making them unique, relevant and meaningful to your business and your people.\nI hope you’ve found this helpful.

    "content": "5 tips for having company values as unique as your company\nDebra Corey\nMar 15, 2023\n5 min read\nUpdated:\nMar 2\nLet me ask you a question - if each company has its own unique mission, purpose, culture, products, services, etc., then why do so many have the exact same company values? This is the question I pose to companies time and time again, challenging them to take a fresh look at their values, asking themselves if they really achieve the following seven objectives:\nDefine who we are as a company — helping us stand out from our competitors.\nDefine our company culture — explaining what it’s like to work here.\nGuide and drive the right business and people decisions and actions so that we can achieve our purpose/mission.\nHelp push us to be our best now and in the future.\nRepresent what we look like at our best.\nDeliver a positive and consistent experience to our customers.\nEnsure a positive and engaging experience for our employees.\nIf one or more of the answers to these questions is no, then read on, where I will share with you five tips from my book on company values (\nBringing Your Values Out to Play\n). These tips can help you discover or rediscover values which can achieve these objectives and support your business.\n1. Are they servants to my purpose or mission?\nThe first question you should ask is, which values will help you be\nservants\nto your purpose or mission? Which will support, align and drive your company’s purpose or mission forward, keeping you focused on what your business is trying to achieve.\nOne of my favorite Olympic stories brings this concept to life, and is written about in the book\nWill it Make the Boat Go Faster\nby Harriet Beveridge and Ben Hunt-Davis. In it, they tell the story of how the British Olympic rowing team in 2000 used one single question, “Will it make the boat go faster?” to help them win a gold medal.\nWhat I love about this story is that the British team were the underdogs (who doesn’t love an underdog, right?). In fact, if you listen to the commentator you’ll hear that up until the very end of the race he expected them to crash and burn, and to lose the lead they’d maintained throughout the race. But driven by their uncompromising focus on their mission of winning a gold through their commitment to their one question, they surprised the world and won. If in the business world, we adopt this approach of using our values as a way to stay true to our purpose and mission, using them to focus us in the right direction, then I strongly believe our workforce and businesses will perform and win in this competitive world we operate in.\n2. Are they specific to my company?\nAnother question to ask is, which values will be specific to my company? I already said that they need to be specific to your purpose and mission, but this isn’t enough as you need to have values that specifically relate to and are meaningful to your culture and to your way of working, helping you say and do things in your own way? As Patrick Lencioni said in an article in the Harvard Business Review, “Cookie-cutter values don’t set a company apart from competitors; they make it fade into the crowd.” In addition to this, if you have values that are not specific to your company, employees will see them as just another thing that HR ‘did to them’!\nTo illustrate this point, here are six examples from companies I interviewed in my book who designed their own specific values that have their root in the concept of\ninnovation\n:\nAtlassian - Be the change you seek.\nC-Space -  Do what scares you.\ngiff gaff - Be curious: We talk. We listen. We challenge. We find a better way.\nNav - Unruly: Ruthlessly creative in challenging the status quo while never accepting roadblocks.\nReward Gateway - Push the boundaries.\nZappos - Be adventurous, creative and open-minded.\n3. Can (and will) they be lived and acted on?\nThe next question, or rather point to make, is that once values are put in place there will be an expectation that they will be lived and acted on. This means that both the business and employees will be expected to behave and make decisions based on these, so make sure that they are not only liveable, but by acting on them it will drive the right behaviors.\nBe absolutely clear about this upfront so that when ideas and values start to fill the wall, participants understand the consequences of each and every value. And remember, values aren’t just for good days, but for rainy ones, for ones when you need to easily and swiftly move from Plan A to Plan B. Effective values drive actions at all levels and at all times.\n4. Can (and will) they take us to a new planet?\nThe next question is about the future, and looks at which values you need to take you to a new “planet”, achieving your future goals and objectives. In Patrick Lencioni’s book\nThe Advantage\nhe calls these\naspirational values\n, saying that  “They are neither natural nor inherent, which is why they must be purposefully inserted into the culture.”\nToo often we focus on the here and now in the values exercise, so the more you can make this point about the future, the better chance you have at getting there safely, and, at the same time, not having to revisit your values again.\nTo illustrate this, let me share an example of what CarTrawler did as their company grew, evolving their values to support their growth. As Gillian French, former Chief People Officer, explained, “The company realized a change was needed to ‘grow up’ and support the emerging business. We asked ourselves, are our values serving us well, or do they need to change to be able to handle our further growth?”\nAn example was the change from the value of ‘Collaboration’ to ‘Smart Collaboration.’ The reason was that as the company grew it became clear that the old manner of collaboration wasn’t working; in fact, it was hampering development. They felt that ‘Smart Collaboration’ worked better as it encourages employees to deploy autonomy in their day-to-day tasks, setting them and the business up for success.\n5. Do my values work together?\nThe final question, and one which many companies don’t consider, is, how will your values work together to get the job done? Too often individual values sit alone, or in some situations, conflict with each other, which makes it difficult for employees to decide if/when to live them. I like to think of them as puzzle pieces, working together to drive your people and business.\nHere are two examples of how companies are doing this:\nThe first is from Expensify, where on their website they explain how their their values (or what they call Rules) ‘Get Shit Done’ and ‘Don’t Ruin It For Everybody Else’ work together as follows: “Both rules work in tandem to steer us quickly and safely on our journey: Rule\n#1\nis the accelerator, driving us forward quickly, and in the right direction. Rule\n#2\nis the brakes, ensuring we do so as a compassionate community, preventing us from going off the edge.”\nThe second example is from WD-40, who I interviewed for my book, who rank their values. As Garry Ridge, former CEO said, “We recognize that life is full of conflicts when it comes to living values. Sometimes you can’t honor two values at the same time. That’s why our values are force-ranked, and our first value, doing the right thing, is more important than all others.” says Garry Ridge, CEO.\nI hope you’ve found this helpful. If you’d like to learn more about discovering and bringing your values out to play, please check out my book ‘Bringing Your Values Out to Play,’ my ‘DIY Values Toolkit,’ or contact me as I love talking about and helping companies discover and design unique and meaningful values.

    "content": "Building engagement is all about having the ‘right’ tools\nDebra Corey\nNov 11, 2018\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nDec 19, 2020\nLet me start out by saying that I am absolutely rubbish at throwing a ball. Always have been, and always will be! However, a friend of mine recently taught me how to use a ball launcher gadget that miraculously transformed me into a world-class ball thrower, and, at the same time reminded me of the importance of having the ‘right’ tools for employee engagement (and life!).\nSo back to the ball launcher. You may be thinking, what planet do I live on, as these gadgets, these tools, have been around for years. And you’d be right, for in fact I’d bought one years ago, and it had stood collecting dust right by my front door just waiting to be used.\nSo why didn't I ever use it? It was partly down to the fear of the unknown – would I be able to use it and would my dogs enjoy it, and it was partly down to not understanding the power of the tool. As I write this I realize how insane this was, as it was actually quite easy to learn to use after only three failed attempts, and the smiles on my dog’s faces (yes, dogs do smile) as they chased after these far flung balls was fantastic!\nThis concept of the ‘right’ tool works not just with ball throwing, but with employee engagement as I’ve learned over the years and more recently when researching and writing our book ‘Build it: The rebel playbook for employee engagement’. By filling your engagement ‘toolkit’ with the ‘right’ tools you have a way better chance of achieving employee engagement, which as we all know is good for your employees and for your business.\nBut just like with my dusty ball launcher, so many of us are ignoring the ‘right’ tools, which we may either not know about or in fact, may be sitting right by our front ‘door’.\nHere are a few tips on how to find these ‘right’ tools and to help you as you build employee engagement at your company:\n1. Ask your employees\nLet me start out with the obvious, which is your secret weapon, your ball launcher, and that is your employees. Now I’m not talking about an annual employee engagement survey, but something more real-time, more focused, something that will help you really understand what’s important to them, and what tools will be right to engage with them.\nFor example, when I was doing a global benefits review I went right to my employees and did what I called ‘cake and chat session’ with my employees around the world. Had I not done this I would have most definitely ended up with the wrong benefits, ones that did little to meet their needs, and little to improve engagement.\n2. Challenge what you’re doing already\nNext, it’s important when looking for new tools to challenge the tools and processes that you are already using.\nFor example, in our book we tell of Gap’s approach to performance management, and how they ditched the annual performance appraisal and moved to something they call ‘GPS’, which stands for grow – perform – succeed.\nA GPS in your car lets you set your destination, and if you make a wrong turn as you’re driving it recalculates in real time and gets you back on the right path. We wanted managers to be like a real GPS – course-correcting employee performance throughout the year.\nRob Ollander-Krane, Director of Talent Planning and Performance\nHere’s a\nlink\nto a video interview where Rob shares more with me on the GPS program as well as the actual play from the book for you to read.\n3. Be brave – give it a go\nAnd finally, I suggest that you be brave. What I mean by this is to not be afraid to try out a new tool. Give it a go, if it works great, then continue using it, and if it doesn’t, then try another tool. Had I done this with the ball launcher my dogs would have had about 3 years of more fun and exercise!\nIn HR we often believe that we need to be perfectionists, that we can’t do anything until it’s 100% right, because we say to ourselves that it’s what our employees deserve.\nWrong. Our employees deserve us to treat them with care and respect, and sometimes that means giving things a go even if it isn’t perfect. As long as you’re open and honest with them when you’re trying out the tool, they’ll respect and engage with you even if you end up changing your mind.\nSo get out there and find the ‘right’ tools to fill your employee engagement toolkit and start building a stronger, more resilient and more engaged workforce. Oh, and don’t forget the ball launcher gadget either, it’s a blast for you and the dogs!\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "14 Building Blocks for Being a Great Boss\nDebra Corey\nMar 27, 2024\n4 min read\nLet me be honest and say that I am a rubbish gardener. My heart is in it, but I lack the skills and knowledge to do it effectively. What this means is that my approach to gardening is to pull out the same one or two tools from the garden shed and attempt to use them in every situation. The result? Well, let's just say that I end up with lots of broken tools and plants that unfortunately need to be replaced.\nWhy do I share this with you when I’m talking about being a great boss? Too often, I see this approach happening with bosses, with ones who are well-intentioned getting it wrong and using the wrong tools in the wrong ways. And as with my garden, the results can be damaging and devastating for their employees and company.\nThat’s exactly why we created our Great Boss Building Block™ model, something that provides the\nright\ntools to deliver the\nright\nresults. What makes it different from other models? Two things - First, it’s\ncomprehensive\n, having 14 different tools that can be pulled out and used to meet the diverse needs of your people and business. Second, it’s\ncurrent\n, having modern tools that meet the changing needs of the evolving workplace, not ones that represent old ways of thinking and working.\nWhat is the Great Boss Building Block™ model?\nGreat Boss Building Block Model\nThere are 14 individual building blocks in the model, and since 14 is a big number, there are two things we’ve done to make it easier to understand and use:\nTwo types of blocks\n- As you may have noticed in the image, there are two types of blocks: the six on the bottom, which we call the “foundation” blocks, and the eight on the top, which we call the “connecting” blocks. The foundation blocks represent behaviors and mindsets required to be a great boss. In the past, they may have been considered “soft and fluffy,” but there’s no doubt about it, they’re more paramount now than ever before. They are called foundation blocks because, like the foundation of any structure, they are absolutely critical as they support the weight of what’s being built, ensuring it has a stable base. The second set of blocks are the eight connecting ones, which connect your people to you and your company, acting as tools to drive employee engagement and build stronger relationships. These blocks represent actions required to be a great boss and are valuable in different ways to meet the diverse needs of your people. These connecting blocks, firmly built together on top of your foundation, create a strong and enduring structure.\nBlocks work in pairs\n- Another thing you may have noticed is that the blocks are shown in pairs, with two sitting alongside each other. This is intentional as they all have a partner, another block that is needed for the other to be effective and/or working towards the same goal.An example are the Authenticity and Vulnerability blocks. They both focus on achieving the same goal, which is to create a\nsense of safety and trust for and with your people, leading to stronger collaboration, connections, creativity, and overall success. These two blocks work together to achieve these goals in different ways. Think of them as things you might “wear” as a great boss.\nWhat are the building blocks?\nSo what are these building blocks? Here are high-level definitions for each of them:\nEmpathy\n– You understand what your people feel and need based on their individual and diverse situations, challenges and frustrations.\nCompassion\n– You take action to encourage and support your people by understanding and empathizing with their individual and diverse needs.\nAuthenticity\n– You determine and display who you are, what you believe in, and your true self to your people.\nVulnerability\n– You reveal to your people the full spectrum of your true self, including your emotions, struggles, and imperfections.\nRespect\n– You believe in the value of your people, recognize their abilities and contributions, and treat them with dignity and courtesy.\nTrust\n– You believe your people will do the right thing because you have confidence in their honesty, integrity, and reliability.\nListening\n– You hear and decode what your people say and suggest, showing that you value their input and contributions.\nCommunication\n– You share information with your people openly, honestly, transparently and continuously.\nFeedback\n– You provide information to your people on how they’ve behaved and performed to help them grow, learn and improve.\nAppreciation\n– You show your people that you recognize, acknowledge, value and appreciate their efforts, accomplishments and contributions.\nDevelopment\n– You help your people create the best approach and plan for them to develop their abilities, learn new skills and achieve their goals.\nCoaching\n– You support and facilitate actions and activities to help your people learn, grow, discover and explore solutions to help them achieve their goals.\nEmpowerment\n– You give your people the freedom, power, control, and space to take ownership of their work.\nInspiration\n– You motivate your people by driving them towards a common purpose to achieve milestones and overcome obstacles and challenges.\nWe hope you’ve found this introduction to the Great Boss Building Block™ model helpful, something you feel could help you be a better boss. For more information and details on the model and how to use it, please check out our book ‘\nBad Bosses Ruin Lives: The Building Blocks for Being a Great Boss\n.’\nLeadership",

    "content": "The Top 7 Myths about Bad Bosses\nDebra Corey\nMar 21, 2024\n4 min read\nThere’s no denying it: bad bosses exist. In fact, according to the survey we conducted for our book, almost everyone (99.6% of survey respondents) has had a bad boss at some point in time.\nBut why? One reason is because of the myths that exist, those misconceptions that get in the way of us being the great boss we want and need to be. Here are seven that we address and bust throughout our book (\nBad Bosses Ruin Lives: The Building Blocks for Being a Great Boss\n), highlighting them so that you and others don’t repeat them yourself.\nAll bad bosses know that they’re bad bosses\n– I’m absolutely sure that if we went to the bosses of those we surveyed, the majority would be shocked to hear that their employees thought they were a bad boss. But mathematically, that can’t be right. We\nknow\nthat bad bosses exist. This is why it’s even more important for you, as a boss, to be self-aware, understanding why, when, and how you may take on bad boss traits, and then overcome them to take actions to be a great one.\nYou’re either a bad, good, or great boss\n– When it comes to being a boss, it is never either/or, all, or nothing. We all have a mix of traits, some bad, some good, and some great. The reality is that there are shades of gray. They come and go based on the situation, the person, and even what’s happening in our lives. The key is understanding what they are and how to deal with and improve them. And keep in mind that even great bosses have bad boss traits.\nEveryone wants the same things from their boss\n– If all our people were the same, life would be easy, and being a great boss would be easy. We’d have one set of instructions to learn, and use them over and over again with our people. But that’s not how it is. Your people all want and need different things from you, and for this reason, you need to understand and adapt so that we can be a great boss to each and every one of them, whatever that looks like.\nThere are only a few skills you need to learn to be a great boss\n– Just like there is not one set of instructions, there aren’t one, two, or three skills to learn, and bang, you’re a great boss. If only! There are a wide variety of skills you need to learn so that you can handle all that your people, your business, and the world throw at you.\nOnce you get it right it’s smooth sailing\n– Wouldn’t it be great if once you finished this book, or any book, or took a course, and presto, you had what it took to be a great boss? It would, but it isn’t! And that’s because being a great boss requires introspection and feedback, commitment and devotion. It is not simple and it is not easy. And to make it even more challenging, just when you think you’ve mastered something things change, and what worked one day in one situation and with one person may not work the next day. If you want to be a great, or at least a good boss, you need to practice, and at the same time adopt a flexible and fluid attitude and approach, setting you up to ride the waves and keep on sailing.\nYou get promoted because you’re a great boss\n– Wrong, you get promoted to be a boss because you were able to do your previous job well. And though this can help you teach your people all that you’ve learned, it’s not automatically going to make you a great boss. In fact, as a new boss, you’re going to have to let go of being the person who knew everything, had all the answers, and focused on your performance. You’ll need to do things very differently going forward. As Ryan Hawk says in his book\nWelcome to Management\n,\n“Being a great manager has nothing to do with how well you performed in your old job.\n”\nBad bosses don’t ruin lives\n– Not every bad boss ruins lives, for as we’ve said, there are different degrees and levels of bad bosses. But we’ve heard the stories, we’ve had it happen to us personally, and we can say without hesitation that there are definitely bad bosses who are indeed ruining lives. They are having such a profound impact on how they’re making their people feel at work that they can’t walk away from it, shake it, or wash it off, and they bring it home. Home to their family, their friends, and their lives. As a boss, we know this is the last thing you want to do. That’s why we are on this mission to set you up for success, being a great boss who sends your people home after a rewarding day at work to have a great day and a great life.\nIf we are ever going to rid the world of bad bosses, helping each and every one of us be great, we need to bust these myths. We need to accept that there are bad boss traits in all of us,\nnot just the few\n. We need to discuss and understand our bad boss traits so that we can accept those that apply to us,\ninstead of denying that they exist\n. And we need to equip ourselves with new skills so we’re able to tackle our bad boss traits,\ninstead of trying to be a great boss using bad boss techniques and approaches\n. We need to walk into them and not away from them.

    "content": "5 tips for communicating change - the hunt for the chocolate Easter egg\nDebra Corey\nApr 16, 2019\n4 min read\nUpdated:\nApr 5, 2023\nWhat do you do when your company decides to remove a long honored tradition, something like, let’s say, giving your employees chocolate eggs at Easter? How do you communicate the change in a way that doesn’t make your employees hopping mad?\nBelieve it or not, this was the conversation we had recently when I led a communications workshop, with one group selecting this scenario as the one they’d tackle as they learned and practiced my\nIMPACT approach to communications\n.\nIt started out as a bit of fun, although it was actually a true situation for one of the attendees. But as it turned out, it ended up being a great scenario for discussing the importance of getting your communications right, especially when taking something away from your employees – even something as simple as a chocolate Easter egg.\nI thought I’d share some of the key takeaways from this discussion to help you should you face a similar challenge:\n1. Get a feel for reactions.\nHave you ever given your child the ‘wrong’ Easter egg (or anything else)? And instead of jumping for joy, they sit in the corner and pout. Well that’s exactly what can happen if you don’t take the time to understand your employees before you go and share the news with them.\nFor example, how did they feel about receiving the egg to begin with? Was it really important to them? Did they possibly bring it home and give it to a loved one? Or possibly, did many just throw it away because they didn’t even like chocolate (is that even legal?!).\n“By understanding how your employees may react, you’ll be able to communicate in a more effective way, covering their key concerns or pushbacks.”\n2.  Start by explaining the why.\nWe all agreed that the most important message employees needed to hear from us was why this was happening, so why were the eggs no longer being given out. If you dance around this or sugar coat it, all you do is create a group of angry and disengaged employees.\nFor example, if you’re ending this tradition because the business needs to find ways to save money, be truthful and tell them this. If you’re doing it because you found that 50% of the eggs were left on desks because people didn’t want them, again, tell them this. Whatever the truth, share it with them.\n“Your employees deserve to hear the truth. And if you don’t tell them it, trust me, they’ll create their own version of the truth . .. . which is often worse than the actual truth!”\n3.  Make sure the message is heard.\nPicture this, you send out an all-employee email announcing that chocolate Easter eggs aren’t being handed out, and  . . . no one reads the email and . . . your entire workforce shows up in the HR office demanding their chocolate!\nSound like something out of a science fiction film? Trust me, it can and will happen if you rely on one method for communicating your announcement. The group talked about the variety of ways you could ensure that each and every employee hears the news, doing so through team briefings, posting the news on the company intranet, or even hanging posters in toilets (we did get into a strange conversation on the power of toilet communication, but that’s something for another blog!\n4.  Consider who should send the message.\nAnother topic of hot debate was the question – who should send out the message? At first, some suggested it be sent out by HR, but quickly the group came to the conclusion that since it was a business decision, the message needed to come from the business.\nIn HR we often think, or are told, that we need to be the bearer of bad news. Why? Shouldn’t it come directly from the person/group who made the decision? We need to push back more on this, as it is not only better for us, but better for the audience, our employees.\n5.  Think carefully about the use of humor.\nThe final topic the group debated was the use of humor, or in some situations, the holding back of humor. We had a great discussion as to when and why to use humor, and ended up agreeing that humor is not a ‘no-no’, but should be used with caution, making sure that everyone will perceive it as funny and not just being rude or disrespectful.\nUsing the example of removing the Easter egg, although one member of the team created a clever line about the company being lean and helping employees be  lean, we all agree probably not best to joke about something as important (and emotional) as food!\nSo there you go, five things to keep in mind when you next communicate to your employees. I hope you found them helpful, and feel free to share others with me.\nIf you'd like to chat about how to get your communications right, please contact me, I'd love to help you.\nCommunication",

It brings back memories of sitting around the table with people I love and respect, sharing stories of thanks and creating new moments to be thankful for.\nAs I’ll be on a plane travelling to Bulgaria to speak at an HR conference on Thanksgiving this year, I won’t be celebrating it, so instead I thought I’d do something different. I’d like to create and share with you a special Thanksgiving table, one filled with five people who have made 2018 a very special year.\nNow before my family and friends wonder why they’re not listed, it’s because this is my professional Thanksgiving table, so people who have inspired and supported me throughout the year. And if I work with you and you’re not listed, please don’t be offended as I needed to keep this to blog-length. So here goes . . .\nGlenn Elliott\nGlenn is the co-author of the book we published this year, ‘Build it: The Rebel Playbook for Employee Engagement’, and I am eternally thankful for him coming into my life. He not only gave me the opportunity to write this very special book with him, but working with Glenn has truly changed who I am as a professional and as a person, pushing me to be better in every way.\nI now think and act like a rebel, doing so in words and by speaking at events around the world. Without Glenn I would have never been given this voice, this opportunity and the courage, so thank you to this caring, supportive and just as important, demanding person who inspires me and others every day.\nThis is the first picture taken of Glenn and I when we met speaking at a conference.\nClaude Silver\nSpeaking of caring, I’d like to thank Claude, who is the Chief Heart Officer at VaynerMedia, and someone I met through Glenn. Claude is an inspiration to myself and others on the importance of leading through empathy. As she wrote in a recent\nblog\n, “Empathy is the secret sauce. Use it on everything.”\nHere’s a link to a\nvideo interview\nshe did with Glenn, where they’ll both inspire you.\nGarry Ridge\nNext is Garry, CEO of WD-40, who I met at a conference in the U.S. when I got up my courage to approach him to to review our book. He graciously agreed, and since then he’s continued to give to me through sharing his advice and wisdom, as well as to others through his speaking and writing.\nIt’s so wonderful to hear Garry talk about his people, or what he calls his ‘tribe’, he is truly an inspiration to other CEOs and business leaders.\nJosh Bersin\nJosh is another person I met at a conference, again asking him to review our book. He kindly agreed to do this as well as squeeze in a video interview with me.\nJosh is an inspiration with his studies and article, pushing our thinking on conventional topics and processes, and making us all better in how we treat our people.\nKatarina Berg\nLet me say that I’ve never met Katarina, CHRO of Spotify, so she may be surprised to see herself on my list. The reason for this is to say and show how we all can be touched and influenced by others by their actions, regardless if you meet them.\nThe work that Katarina and her team at Spotify are doing is inspirational on it’s own, but the way they share it with others takes it that one step further. I am thankful for their approach, and the difference they’re making to myself and others.\nI’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.\nMaya Angelou\nAs you can see, my list is as diverse as the five individuals I listed, as inspiration comes in many ways. And to add a bit more inspiration, let me share with you a\nlink\nto some of the books and TED Talks that have inspired me the most over the last year, I hope you enjoy them!\nSo let me end by wishing you all a happy Thanksgiving, whether you celebrate the holiday or not. For to me, this holiday is about being thankful and appreciating others, so feel free to do that in your own special way.\nEmployee Engagement",

Expecting the usual one-word response, he surprised me by telling me all about how his company had given him two appreciation awards, and how much it had meant to him.\nSince many of us are trying our best to understand and support our Gen Z employees, I thought I’d share this conversation with you. It includes his answers to my questions, as well as my thoughts. I hope you find both perspectives helpful.\nWhat recognition awards did you receive?\nHim:\nI received two different awards. The first was for the work we did on completing a project, and the second was for work we did organizing and conducting a PR-related task.\nMe:\nI like that his company recognized\ndifferent types\nof work (one was for a project and one was for a task), showing that both are valued. I also liked that they recognized\ndifferent time frames\n(one was long-term work and another short-term work), as it shows appreciation for all moments that matter, big and small.\n“Recognition should not be one dimensional. It needs to have multiple dimensions to reflect the way your people work, contribute and deserve to be appreciated.”\nHow did it make you feel when you received these awards?\nHim:\nIt made me very happy and very proud of our work and accomplishments. I used the award voucher to buy new clothes, which also made me happy.\nMe:\nI like that his company gave him a voucher as I’m a big believer in recognition awards that provide choice to employees, letting them decide what is right for them. And as a mother, I loved that these awards made him both happy and proud, fantastic!\nSome might say that these awards were given for doing your ‘day job,’ what do you think about this?\nHim:\nI believe that we deserved these awards as we exceeded expectations for the work that we were asked to do. For the first award, the project, we got it done early, which was great for our company and customers. And for the second award, the PR work, it went so much better than it was expected to go, which again was good for our company.\nMe:\nI asked this question as it’s something I’m asked quite often when doing talks on recognition, so I thought it would be interesting to get his perspective on it. I was pleased that he saw the difference between completing his work and doing something that is above and beyond, and thus deserves a recognition award. It’s important that this distinction is understood when programs are designed and awards are given.\nBy receiving these awards, will it make you expect to be recognized all the time?\nHim:\nNo, I wouldn’t expect to receive awards all the time. In fact, I didn’t expect to receive either of these awards.\nMe:\nI asked this question to make the point that giving recognition doesn’t necessarily set expectations, something that I know many businesses fear. He was surprised and delighted receiving both awards, and as he response shows, it didn’t cause him to think that he’d be recognized each and every time he completed work.\nWhy is appreciation important for Gen Z’s?\nHim:\nIt teaches my generation the meaning and importance of appreciation, something we don’t really know much about as we’re new to the workplace. It also shows us what our company values and thinks is important, and what we should work and focus on.\nMe:\nHe made a really good point in that this generation is still learning - learning what their company values and how their company feels about and treats them. Recognition is a great tool to teach them these important lessons, and by making appreciation an integral part of your culture it can not only show these young workers what good and great look like, but that you see and value their contributions. And since they will be our future leaders, it creates leaders who will make appreciation a part of how they lead and support their people.\nPlease\ncontact me\nif you'd like to discuss how you can create innovative and effective recognition programs at your company.\nTags:\nAppreciation\nRecognition\nRecognition",

    "content": "Three tips for closing the innovation gap\nDebra Corey\nJan 23, 2021\n3 min read\nAccording to an\narticle\npublished in June last year, 90% of executives agreed that the COVID-19 crisis would fundamentally change the way they do business over the next five years; but that fewer than 30% felt they were adequately prepared to address these changes. Conclusion? A significant innovation gap exists in the world of modern business - namely, a gap between what the organization needs, and what it's equipped for.\nSix months on, companies are still facing challenges, but many have jumped onboard the ‘innovation bus’, closing the gap by using innovation to drive change when it comes to their people and their businesses. I shared examples of such innovation in my eBook, Bringing your values out to play, highlighting how companies have truly thought outside the box to care for and support their employees.\nCompanies have also shown pandemic-era innovation in how they drive revenue and generate new opportunities. A great example is Japanese restaurant group Sticks’n’Sushi, which has had to shift its focus to takeaway in recent times. The group quickly adapted its operations to handle the increased volume, and with objectives of sharing the same quality food and the same experience into the homes of the customers, the team innovated and conceived a new product: takeaway cocktails.\nLed by Head of Bar, Enrique Gomez, the company designed the cans and labels, created a process for production and distribution, and were able to take the product to market in just three weeks. A shimmering example of innovation in action.\nBut for meaningful innovation to happen, there are certain requisite actions. To help you with this, I’m sharing three tips taken from an interview I conducted with the king of innovation himself: Dominic Price, Work Futurist at Atlassian.\n1. Make innovation an integral part of your company values and behaviors\nInnovation should not be the role of a single person, project, or team. It is each and every employee’s role. For this reason, your definition and ways of innovating need to be woven into your values and behaviors. Whether your value is '\npush the boundaries'\n(Reward Gateway), or '\ndream big'\n(Missguided), or ‘\ndo what scares you\n' (C Space), it’s important to find a word or phrase that fits your mission and culture, so your employees know that it’s a part of their job, and that you expect this from them each and every day.\nDuring my interview, Dominic said: \"One of our values is ‘be the change you seek’; if you don't like what you see or what you do, you're empowered to change it. You have to change it for good and not for evil, and good being the greater good. You can't just change things that work for you at the detriment of the other 2,500 employees.\"\n2. Don’t compromise when it comes to diversity\nIf you put five similar people into a room and ask them to each come up with a new product or idea, it's likely that they will be roughly the same across the board. Introduce diversity, whether that’s through background, experience, lifestyle, gender, race, or religion, and that’s where the magic happens.\n\"I have learned that if I get these cognitively diverse people around me, they will rip my idea to shreds,\" said Dominic. \"They'll then put it back together again. What we're left with is far better than I would have come up with myself. At Atlassian we hire for a growth mindset. I want someone who disagrees with me, but that helps me solve the problem.\"\n3. Keep evolving your innovation ‘ways’\nAs with anything, we need to continually find ways to do things differently as times and challenges change. As Dominic explained to me in my interview, “we’re constantly evolving how we do things”. In my book, he shared the details around Atlassian's ‘20% time’ policy (where teams earmark one day a week to focus on innovation), and the ‘ShipIt’ program (where every quarter, the teams set aside a full 24 hours to work together and innovate whatever inspires them the most.\nSince then, Atlassian has further evolved its approach, ensuring that innovation continues to thrive even in a remote culture. \"You gotta carry on innovating, right?,\" said Dominic. The company has also pivoted to inject some focus on current themes such as Black Lives Matter and the impacts of COVID-19.\n\"To stay relevant, you have to be evolving at a faster pace than the environment,\" Dominic said. \"You have to be able to give up the legacy of what was successful for you before.\"\nI hope these three tips will help you drive innovation at your company, closing the gap between what you need and what you deliver.\nThis blog originally appeared on\nHRD Connect\n.\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "Socking it to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\nDebra Corey\nApr 8, 2021\n4 min read\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) is an important topic, one that many organizations are talking about and trying to figure out just how to get it right. In this blog I’d like to introduce you to a company that is not only talking about it, but socking it to it, taking a rebellious approach to how they address and embrace it.\nThe company is\nJohn’s Crazy Socks\n, an online sock company based in Long Island, New York, that was founded by the father and son team of Mark and John Cronin in 2016. John, who has Down syndrome, decided he wanted to go into business with his father, and came up with the idea of selling socks. The company’s received lots of attention and press, with John appearing on ABC News, Money Magazine, BBC and CBS News to name a few, sharing the story of how he and his father have built a successful business. They’ve become role models on the power of DEI, and are on a mission to showcase this approach to others.\n\"We have a social mission and a retail mission, and they are indivisible. We want to show what is possible when you give someone a chance. Every day, we demonstrate what people with intellectual disabilities can do.\" Mark Cronin, Co-Founder John's Crazy Socks\nIn addition to tackling DEI inside the walls of their warehouse, they also host school tours, speak at conferences and events, and advocate changes in law and policy to support the rights of people with differing abilities to work and to retain their earnings. They are truly going above and beyond to showcase a successful business model and approach, one that can and should be used by others.\nAs Mark Cronin says, \"John and I are just a bunch of knuckleheads from Long Island selling socks, if we can do it anyone can.\"\nJohn’s Crazy Socks’ approach to DEI begins with their mission of spreading happiness. “Everything we do is designed to spread happiness. The more we can do for others, the more we can make people happy, the better off we are” says Mark.\nTo go alongside the mission are their four values - inspiration and hope, giving back, socks you can love and making it personal. The one which I believe sums up their approach to DEI is the value of “inspiration and hope,” which shows the world what is possible, and what people with differing abilities can do when given a chance.\nTheir approach demonstrates that when you work with people with special needs they become an asset and a reason for success, and not a liability and an obstacle.\nWhat makes them rebellious is how they’ve turned these words into action. It starts with their recruitment strategy. Beyond hiring just one disabled employee to “tick the box,”  more than half of John’s Crazy Socks workforce is made up of employees with differing abilities.\n\"Our hiring is not altruistic, it’s not charity, it’s a good business decision\" says Mark.\nWith a growing labor shortage, especially in their industry, this hiring approach takes advantage of untapped talent, giving them a competitive advantage with workers who as Mark says \"are excited to come to work, excited to be there, and can be relied on to get the job done.\"\nAnd it’s not just about the hiring, it’s what they do next in how they treat these employees once they walk in the door. Instead of isolating them or giving them little to nothing to do as done by some companies, he gives them “proper” jobs, with the majority working as “Sock Wranglers” picking the orders or as “Happiness Packers,” verifying and packing orders. Great job titles, which are just as much fun as the socks they make!\nAll employees, regardless of their disability, need to earn their job. So after shadowing a current employee, they’re required to take and pass a test. For this, the company brings back their value of “making it personal” by looking past disabilities and focusing on what they can do to teach and set each individual employee up for success to pass the test. For example, they had one employee who was autistic, and for his test they focused on the mechanical side of learning and not the interpersonal side which was difficult for him, for it wasn’t actually critical to the job.\nOnce in the job the personal support continues. Mark meets with supervisors to understand if there are any specific issues that need to be addressed, and at times, he’s even met with family members to understand if either they or the employee requires further support. An example was when they introduced free snacks. For a few employees with autism they’d eat the snacks all day long, so to help them they set up a schedule of when they could come and have snacks. This shows their ongoing, and as Mark calls it, their “multi-layering” approach to helping and caring for all of their employees.\nThere have been many positive impacts of this rebellious approach. From a retention perspective, they’ve only a few employees and that is because the experience at John's Crazy Socks helped them \"graduate\" to better jobs. From a business perspective, the business is absolutely thriving, in their first four years they’ve shipped over 320,000 orders, earned $10 million in revenue and have donated over £425,000 to their charity partners. It’s partly down to all of the press coverage they’ve had, but that can only get you so far. What’s really made them a success is how they’ve engaged each and every employee to bring out the best in them, socking it to DEI and spreading happiness along the way.\nAnd finally, as Mark explained, it benefits everyone, making them feel part of something.\n“It’s not just a job, you get to work with these folks and see the difference you can make. Everyone wants to be part of a mission larger than themselves.”\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "11 ways to bring your values out to play\nDebra Corey\nJul 26, 2023\n4 min read\nIn a previous\nblog\nI provided tips on discovering or rediscovering the ‘right’ values, ones that guide and focus your employees to make the right decisions and take the right actions for your business. Unfortunately, this can only take you so far. For if you don’t ‘bring them out to play’ as I write about in my book ‘\nBringing Your Values Out to Play,\n’ they’ll never do their job to help you achieve your mission and objectives.\nSo in this blog I’ll focus on this concept of bringing your values out to play, sharing how you can embed them to drive\nawareness, understanding and actions\n.\nWhy do you need to bring your values out to play?\nBefore explaining how to embed your values, how to bring them out to play, let me first explain why this is important. Here is how I explained it in my book . . .\nI love designing gardens, researching which plants to buy, where they should be placed, and how they’ll all work together to create a flourishing tapestry to be seen and appreciated throughout the year. But for me that’s where it ends, for as much as I love designing gardens, I really don’t enjoy tending them.\nHowever, I’ve learned the hard way that if I don’t tend my garden it ends up with weeds popping up everywhere, some plants getting too big and overshadowing others, it’s an absolute disaster!\nThe same thing can and will happen if you don’t ‘tend’ your values, or what I write about in my book ‘bring them out to play.’ For although they may be\nthe\nbest values, like a garden, if they aren’t nourished, tended and maintained by fully embedding them into each and everything you do, they’ll never flourish.\nBrené Brown, researcher and author, writes in her book\nDare to Lead\n, “only about 10 percent of organizations have operationalized their values into teachable and observable behaviors that are used to train their employees and hold people accountable.”\nNo wonder\nonly 23% of employees can apply their values\n- we aren’t making it easy for them by bringing them out to play!\nYour values checklist\nThe concept of bringing your values out to play focuses you on embedding them, making them integral parts of the employee experience. Going back to the gardening analogy, think of it as sprinkling your values on every employee touchpoint so that they’re seen and felt everywhere.\n“People have well-honed bullshit detectors these days. If the only time people encounter your company’s values is on a PowerPoint slide at their induction, they’re never going to stick. Values must be lived to be believed, and if they aren’t, they’ll simply fade away.” Nikki Gatenby,\nSuperengaged\nNow I know that each organization is different, and thus the employee experience is different, but to give you a starting point for this embedding process, let me share with you the checklist I use when working with clients. Feel free to use it to check that your values are embedded in the right places, adding any other touchpoints that exist at your company.\n1. Careers website\n- Values have a prominent place on your careers website so that before candidates apply for a job they understand what your company values are and if they are right for them.\n2. Recruitment\n- Values are used throughout the recruitment process, with candidates asked specific questions to determine if/how your values apply to them so that you hire people who believe in and will live your values.\n3. Onboarding\n- Values are a part of the onboarding process, with new employees learning what they are, what they mean, and how they can be applied in their new role.\n4. Policies\n- Values are considered as policies, both HR and business, are designed so that they align with what your values stand for.\n5. Benefits\n- Values are considered as employee benefits (including wellbeing programs) are put in place so that they align with what your values stand for.\n6. Performance Management\n- Values are an integral part of the performance management process so that employees understand which are strengths and which are development opportunities.\n7. Learning & Development\n- Programs are in place that support the development of the behaviors that go along with your values so that employees can live them at their best.\n8. Recognition\n- Programs are in place that recognize employees for living your values, showing them that you appreciate their efforts for doing so.\n9. Communication\n- Values are an integral part in how and what you communicate to your employees, giving them a starring role.\n10. Workspace\n- Values can be seen in how you design your physical and virtual workspace, making them visible and meaningful in doing so.\n11. Business processes\n- Managers are encouraged to lead their business processes in ways that align with your values, e.g. in how they run meetings, work together, develop their people, etc.\nLet me end by encouraging you to use this checklist (or any other tool) to help you bring your values out to play. Make it a continuous part of your review and planning processes, ensuring that your values are lived and actioned, setting your people and business up for success.\nPlease\ncontact me\nwith any questions you have, or for help in bringing your values out to play at your company. I'd love to help you!\nTags:\nCompany values\nCompany Values",

    "content": "4 tips for figuring out which company values to invite ‘to the table’\nDebra Corey\nApr 25, 2024\n4 min read\nIn a previous\nblog\nI talked about the importance of having values as unique as your company. Great, but as I’m often asked when I work with organizations, how do you do  this? To answer this, let me share some tips from the second step of my\nWTH process\nwhich includes the following:\nW = Put your values on the wall, coming up with a long list of potential values\nT = Invite your values to the table\nH = Bring your values home, making them your own\nThis second step is where you take the long list of potential values from the first step, refining and prioritizing those that\ndeserve a seat at the table\n. And like a table, there are only so many seats around it, so it’s here that you have those difficult (but lively) discussions in order to decide which ones are and which ones are not seat worthy.\nYour company values should be ones that you just can’t walk away from as they are so critical to the life, health and success of your business.\nOne approach for helping you narrow down and fine tune your list of values is by using the “keep, kill, and combine” process. For each value you’ve ‘put on the wall,’ go back and decide which of these three actions to take:\nKeep: put a tick next to these\nThese are the values that tick all if not most of these four questions in step one:\nAre they servants to my purpose or mission?\nAre they specific to my company?\nCan (and will) they be lived and acted on?\nCan (and will) they take us to a new planet?\nThink of them as values that are\nat the heart and core of who you are and what you want and need to be\n.\nKill: draw a line through these\nThese are the values that either don’t tick any of the question boxes or if they tick one, they are in conflict with the others, e.g. could cause problems to these.\nThey could also be what Patrick Lencioni in his book\nThe Advantage\ncalls permission-to-play values, which he describes as being “the minimum behavioral standards that are required in an organization. Values often seen in this category are those such as trust, integrity and ethics. Now don’t get me wrong, these are absolutely essential to have at any company, in fact, they are like the air that we breathe. But my question and challenge is - should they be standalone values? Or instead, should they be woven into your values, thus making them an integral and natural part of how you run your business and how employees behave?\nFor example, if you believe that trust should be one of your values, ask yourself why? What does trust really mean and why do we need it to make our company great? Is it trust in how you work together, in how you communicate with each other, or in how you respect each other? Pinpoint the behaviors related to trust that you need to see, and then weave these into your values that truly deserve a seat at the table.\nCombine: circle these\nThese are the values that are similar to one another, so could be combined to have a better overall impact. Look for themes amongst these, so that you can narrow them down and cluster them together.\nThe outcome of this step is to have a manageable list that you can take forward to the next step, where you select your ‘winning’ values and make them your own. How you define manageable is up to you, the focus at this stage should be less about the number of values and more about the quality of values. Take forward those that you can easily and readily explain and defend - that is the key.\nAnd speaking of taking them forward, there is one more thing I’d suggest doing before going to the final step, which is to\ntest them out\n. The result of this is that you feel confident that you have stress tested your draft values by running them by your leaders and workforce to see if/how they resonate with them. It’s important to go through this process with them both as they’ll have different needs and different perspectives. Here’s what I mean . . . .\nFor leaders\n, you’ll need to test that the values are ones that will drive the business strategy and at the same time drive the right behaviors. They need to ask themselves, will they help me hire the right people - recognize the right behaviors - manage performance - and, when things get tough, help or hinder decision making? Will they help me be a better leader? And finally, will I be able to embrace and role model them?\nFor your workforce\n, you’ll need to test that the values speak to your employees in a way that they help them be understood as well as understand what is expected of them. Try to uncover whether they will create an emotional connection, getting your workforce excited and behind them.\nI hope you’ve found this helpful in either discovering or rediscovering your values. If you’d like to learn more about this you can read my book\nBringing Your Values Out to Play\n, get my\nDIY Values Toolkit\nor\ncontact me\nfor questions or support. All the best!\nTags:\nCompany values\nCompany Values",

    "content": "5 ways to help build communities in the modern workplace\nDebra Corey\nAug 14, 2020\n4 min read\nYears from now, when we look back on the COVID-19 pandemic, one area that will most certainly stand out will be the great work that companies have done to create connections and communities. So great in fact, that I have a white board in my office that’s been completely filled with post it notes of all the innovative and effective ways that this has been done.\nThese ideas have been born out of an urgent desire and need for connection and community. With so much uncertainty and fear in the world, these connections and these communities can help in meaningful and powerful ways. And with statistics showing an increase in loneliness and mental illness, this is more important now than ever before.\n“Coronavirus and social distancing has forced all of us to look loneliness in the eye. So recognising the signs and tackling the stigma has never been more important.” Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden.\nTo help you as you continue to develop ways to connect your workforce and build communities, let me share with you five of the key themes and trends:\n1. Ramp up communications\nOne area that’s had a huge impact when it comes to connecting employees is communications. Companies have really ramped up their employee communications, tapping into existing communication vehicles and/or creating new and innovative ones to provide a lifeline between the organisation and their workforce. Here are a few examples of what companies have done:\nCEO blog - Companies have realised and seen the importance of having their CEO step up and communicate more frequently throughout the pandemic. Many have created a weekly blog where the CEO provides their first-hand thoughts, perspectives and information on what’s happening at their company.\nLive Q&A sessions - Another great communications tool has been live Q&A sessions, which companies have found to be useful in providing employees with the opportunity to raise their questions and concerns and have immediate responses.\nMeet the executives - Another example is something called “meet the executives”, which a company I interviewed added to their weekly All Hands virtual meetings. Executives shared pictures from their childhoods, including awkward teenage photos, and told stories of pivotal moments in their lives that made them who they were today. By doing this, it showed the human side of their executives, showing vulnerability, sharing stories and acting in a way to bring the team closer together.\n2. Share stories\nA key part of communications is storytelling, something that many companies have leveraged as a way to connect their workforce to the business and to one another. Here are a few examples of what companies have done:\nPost stories - In a previous HRD blog, I shared an example of a company who put in place a “Happy Monday” campaign as a vehicle for employees to share positive stories on their online communications portal to connect and support one another. Other companies have done this in similar ways, encouraging employees to post stories either in written format or in videos.\nOnline channels - Other companies have set up online channels (e.g. Slack), where employees can share stories on a continuous basis, having “drive-by” conversations.\n3. Organise company-wide events\nCompanies have quickly embraced the new digital world, and have moved company-wide events online. Anything from weekly briefings to quarterly or annual meetings, companies have found that it's important to keep this aspect of ‘business-as-usual’ going to maintain connections and communities.  One of my favourite examples is a company who sent employees a voucher to order pizza for their annual meeting as a way to replicate the face-to-face experience.\nAnd it’s not just meetings, companies have truly put their innovation hats on when it came to organising fun company-wide events. From chess lessons, to mindfulness sessions, to cooking or cocktail making classes, to magic shows, and even virtual murder mystery events, there certainly has been something for everyone. And the extra benefit of these events is that they’ve increased connections between employees, with them interacting with and building relationships with new members of the team.\n4. Organise company-wide competitions\nWho doesn’t love a competition? Which is exactly why many companies have used them as a way to connect and get their workforce involved. I’ve seen competitions for anything and everything, ranging from the best office, to the best pet, to even the best design to be used on posters explaining how to safely wash your hands. And the great thing about these competitions is that many companies involved children, which gave their employees a way to connect with their children and their children to connect with their company. Anything from a children’s poetry competition, to designing a recognition eCard, to Easter crafts, again, the sky was the limit to these competitions.\n5. Create networks\nAnd finally, companies have gone above and beyond to create networks, ways to create connections and all-important communities within their workforce. Many companies did this before, but as in the other areas, they ramped it up to ensure that there were communities for a broader range of areas and topics. One example is parenting networks, where parents can share their challenges and work together to share solutions. The key here, as in the other areas, has been to offer a variety of options that employees can connect with, allowing them to pick and choose what  works best for them.\nSo as we move on, and as we continue to fight this battle, let me encourage you to continue to use the power of connections and communities to support your business and your people. For as Helen Keller, American author, said “Alone, we can do so little; together, we can do so much”.\nThis blog was originally posted on\nHRD Connect\n.\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "Five tips for motivating employees and celebrating the festive season in 2020\nDebra Corey\nNov 24, 2020\n4 min read\nAs an HR leader, finding “the” perfect way to wrap up the end of the year has always been a challenge. How do you figure out what’s right for an increasingly more diverse workforce, in an increasingly more cost-conscious environment?\nThat being said, compared to this year, the challenges of prior years were a “walk in the park” as the expression goes. With companies no longer being able to hold face-to-face holiday parties, team lunches, or end-of-year award events, what do they do? With companies struggling financially, how do they let their employees know that they  appreciate them without having their normal holiday budget?\nBut as with every other challenge you’ve faced in 2020, I’m confident that you can figure out what is the best way to handle it. And to help you, here are five tips:\n1. Start by asking yourself the question “what am I really trying to do”?\nFirst, before jumping into solution mode, it’s important to pause for a moment and ask yourself “what am I really trying to do”? In prior years, common answers to this question would have been:\nTo celebrate the holidays\nTo celebrate the end of the year\nTo thank employees for their contributions\nTo have fun and come together\nAre these the same now? Has the order of importance changed? Based on what’s going on in the world, at your company, and in your employee’s lives, review if/how the answers have changed?\n2. Ask yourself “how do I want my employees to feel”?\nOne of my favourite quotes from the wonderful poet Maya Angelou is:\n“People will forget what you said. People will forget what you did. But people will never forget how you made them feel.”\nThis is so true, and for this reason it’s important to also ask yourself the question of “how do I want my employees to feel” when setting your objectives. Especially at the end of such an extremely challenging year, it’s important to picture what reaction you want to receive from your employees, and develop your plans with this in mind.\n3. Re-think and re-invent how you deliver your objectives\nNext, it’s time to re-think and re-invent how you’ll deliver against your objectives. The good news is that as my spinning instructor often says at the end of a class, “you’re more bada** now than you were at the start”, and the same is true with you. Remind yourself that you’ve gotten this far by re-thinking and re-inventing employee experiences, so I’m confident that you can do it again now!\nAnd the other good news is that as I’m sure you’ve already discovered, there are so many ways to do this by leveraging technology, bringing so much to your employees in a virtual setting. From online games, activities and competitions that you can run in-house, to bringing in companies who have pivoted their services to provide virtual experiences such as cooking classes, theatre, magic shows, escape rooms, craft classes, music and so much more!\n4. Deliver in a diverse and inclusive way\nBefore finalising your plans, it’s absolutely critical to address and meet the needs of your diverse workforce in order to achieve your objectives. Whether it’s diversity in religion, culture, or even in how people are feeling about the holidays in general based on how the year has impacted them personally, it’s important to pause and bring this into your actions.\nFor example, when brainstorming with one company on how to address diversity during the holiday season, we discussed having virtual events where employees could share their traditions, foods, etc. to respect differences, raise awareness, and give everyone a voice.\nAt Missguided, they created special holiday eCards and banners to appear on their communications platform so that colleagues could celebrate Diwali, Hanukkah and Christmas together.\nBottom line, when it comes to anything involving the diverse needs of your workforce, talk to them to understand their differences and wishes, and weave this into your design and delivery.\n5. You don’t have to spend a fortune\nAnd finally, I thought it was important to say that you don’t have to spend a fortune to deliver on your objectives. In fact, if there was ever a time when employees would understand tighter budgets, it’s now. So if you don’t have the budget for holiday bonuses or large gifts, remember it’s the thought that counts and get creative with what you do. And to help you, here are examples from three companies:\nAt\nMissguided\n, they’ve created a digital ‘Totally Terrific Treat Tree’, which will sprout daily prizes. Colleagues will enter a draw to win one of the many daily prizes from the tree, ranging from gifts that cost just a few pounds to those that are more substantial such as a box of brownies or a luxury candle.\nThey’re also running a ‘Snow Place Like Home’ competition, which gives colleagues the chance to submit and vote for their favourite holiday decorations and Christmas trees.\nAnd speaking of competitions, they’ll be running their ‘Awesome Pawsome Pet Show’ again this year, which is their very own virtual pet show. The winners will be featured on specially designed eCards, with a donation being made to an animal charity for each of these cards sent.\nAt\nTeleperformance\n, they’re also doing a variety of low-cost but high-impact things to support their employees during the holidays. Since they also love their competitions, they’re having lots of different ones during the holiday season, giving employees the chance to win prizes and get involved, including sending all employees scratch cards, something that everyone loves.\nAnd they haven’t forgotten their employees' children, as they’re providing them with Santa letters and wish list templates, as well as sending Santa Letters and Christmas-inspired activity packs to TP kiddies.\nAt\neve Sleep\n, they’re also holding special competitions as well as having a ‘Secret Santa’, which is when employees are randomly, and secretly, assigned a person they buy a low-cost, but often comical, gift for.\nThey’re also having a virtual wreath making class, where employees will be sent the parts, and together will learn how to make a lovely wreath.\nSo that’s it from me. I wish you all the best in figuring out what’s “right” at your company, and stay tuned for my next blog sharing tips and examples on holiday events and holiday wellbeing.\nThis blog was originally posted on\nHR Zone\n.\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "How innovation improves performance and helps us sleep better at night\nDebra Corey\nFeb 5, 2019\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nDec 19, 2020\nInnovation can come from the smallest and simplest of changes, it’s about opening up our minds and looking for opportunities – looking for those marginal gains.\nThis was one of my many takeaways from a brilliant talk by Fran Millar, Director of Operations and Head of Winning Behaviour at Team Sky, the British professional cycling team, at the Productivity Summit in London last week.\nFran shared the story of how Team Sky went from being a mediocre to a world-class winning team.\nThe performance of British riders had been so underwhelming that one of the top bike manufacturers in Europe refused to sell bikes to the team because they were afraid that it would hurt sales if other professionals saw the Brits using their gear. – Richard Moore, Mastermind: How Dave Brailsford Reinvented the Wheel\nGetting there was far from easy, and as Fran explained, involved hard work, sacrifices and significant change. One way they did this was through the concept of marginal gains, which involves making small incremental changes which add up to significant improvements.\nTo do this you need to change your mindset and ask yourself, how am I going to be 1% better tomorrow than I am today?\nFor Team Sky it involved innovation and changes that challenged the status quo in a variety of ways. One of my favorites is how they made the rebellious decision to kit out their rider’s hotel rooms during the Tour de France competition, replacing the sub-standard furnishings with personalised pillows and mattresses to help them get a good night’s sleep.\nAs an employee engagement rebel I absolutely love this as it points out a few key things when it comes to being a rebel:\n1. You need to think outside of the box\nFran explained that before they made the decision to re-kit the hotel rooms they went through a variety of other options, all being met with resistance and ultimately opposition. But this didn’t stop them, they pushed on to find a solution that worked for the race organizers as well as Team Sky, thinking completely outside of the box.\nIn HR, we need to do the same thing, challenging what we do, facing up to resistance, and finding a solution that will help us achieve our business and people objectives. An example of this is with how companies such as\nGap Inc\n. are ditching traditional and ineffective performance management programs, ‘re-kitting’ their performance ‘rooms’ and driving performance.\n2. You need to think of your team’s ‘comfort’\nWith Team Sky they focussed on the comfort of their riders, understanding that if they had a good night’s sleep they would perform better in the race the next day.\nIn HR, we need to think and act the same way. Ask ourselves what can we do to meet the needs of our workforce, to make it more comfortable for them and driving engagement for the business?\nAn example of this is what a New Zealand company, Perpetual Guardian, have done in piloting a 4-day work week. What makes this unique (and rebellious) is that they don’t do what others do with 4-day work weeks by compressing 40 hours into 4 days, but instead pay employees to work 5 days, and then expect them to work 4 normal days. This makes it more comfortable for employees, and at the same time drives productivity with employees being more efficient during their reduced schedules.\n3. You’re going to get some strange looks\nAs Team Sky members carried mattresses and pillows in and out of hotel rooms, I’m sure they got some very strange looks. But they didn’t care, they were doing what was right for their team and for their business.\nIn HR, we shouldn’t fear strange looks, in fact, we should aim for them. Examples I write about in my book are Brewdog and their\npawternity leave\nbenefit, LinkedIn and their\nPerkUp! Benefit\n, and Goodman Masson and their\nbenefits boutique\n. They’re all innovative and at the same time, probably got a few strange looks at first!\nIn ending let me encourage you to try out this concept of marginal gains, looking for small yet powerful ways to drive change and improved employee engagement at your company. And, if you’re lucky, they’ll help you all sleep better at night and perform better the next day!\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "How recognition can turn your employees into superheroes\nDebra Corey\nJul 26, 2020\n3 min read\nWe all love superheroes, right? And why not, they possess supernatural or superhuman powers, and, even more important, can use these powers to fight evil and protect us from supervillains.\nBut that’s just in movies, certainly we don’t face supervillains in the workplace? Wrong! Here are three supervillains I’ve come up against who may sound familiar to you as well:\nDoctor Disengagement\n- this supervillain sucks engagement out of your employees, leaving them dissatisfied, unproductive and causing disruption and devastation to your customers and to your business.\nMagnetico\n- this supervillain is a disengaged employee who hides out in your company, and when the time is right swoops in and lures others to join them. They promise them that things are better with them, leaving your business weak and vulnerable.\nThe Infiltrator\n- this supervillain is found in competitor companies, ones that get stronger by weakening your company by infiltrating and stealing your valuable talent. They entice your employees by convincing them to join them in their quest, leaving you again weak and vulnerable.\nBut don’t worry, because I’m here to tell you about a secret weapon that will turn your employees into superheroes, helping you not only destroy supervillains, but help your business succeed in this competitive and challenging world we all operate in.\nAnd the secret weapon is\nrecognition\n, something that I’ve seen time and time again turn ‘normal’ employees into superheroes. Now they may not be able to leap tall buildings or lift a bus, but here are some of the superpowers I’ve seen when recognition is done in a\nstrategic, continuous and meaningful way\n:\nPerform better\n- superheroes are the ones who outperform the likes of anyone and everyone that gets in their way. They use their super powers to overcome obstacles and defeat supervillains, which are exactly the kind of super powers your business needs to defeat the super villains and your competitors.\nNeed proof? According to a survey by Reward Gateway, 70% of employees said that motivation and morale would improve if managers simply said thank you more, and a survey by Socialcast said that 69% of employees said they’d work harder if they felt their efforts were being recognized. I don’t know about you, but if 7 out of my 10 employees became superheroes, I’ve be quite happy!\nAre courageous\n- superheroes are also the first to jump into a burning building to save the day. And while you don’t want your employees to literally do this, you do want ones who are brave enough to innovate and push the boundaries in how they treat your customers, develop your products, and anything else to help your business succeed.\nRecognition is a great way to show your employees that you appreciate them after they perform their super hero acts, encouraging them to do so time and time again.\nLast person standing\n- and finally, superheroes don’t leave until their job is done, not fleeing the scene if things get tough or something better comes along. And again, this concept is just as important for businesses, as you don’t want to lose your superheroes to your competitors.\nAnd again, recognition can help as it doesn’t just turn them into superheroes, but it makes them be the ‘last person standing’ by not leaving you. According to a study by Reward Gateway, 50% of employees would leave their company if they weren’t regularly thanked and recognized for their efforts.\nI challenge you to go out and find ways to use recognition at your company to create your own superheroes. For to quote Superman, “There is a superhero in all of us, we just need the courage to put on the cape.” By appreciating and recognizing your employees, you’re giving them the courage to put on their superhero cape, and setting them free to defeat the supervillains before they defeat you.\nRecognition",

    "content": "4 reasons “carrots” should be used in soups and salads, and not as motivation tools\nDebra Corey\nAug 31, 2018\n4 min read\nUpdated:\nDec 19, 2020\nWe’ve all used extrinsic motivation, or what some call financial ‘carrots’ from time to time, whether it’s at work or at home. For example, getting someone to stay on to finish a project once they’ve been told their role is no longer needed at the company, or getting your kids to walk the dogs when it’s probably the last thing in the world they want to do.\nBut let me ask you, is it really working?\nIs the person staying on working hard or hardly working?\nAre your children giving the dogs a proper walk or are they doing the shortest walk they can possibly get away with?\nI’m asking this question as too often I believe we jump right to this approach as we believe it’s going to be some sort of magic motivational tool. To illustrate this, let me share with you a story.\nMy son Anthony was taking his GCSE exams, which in the UK are the exams taken at age 16. Many of his friends were told they’d receive money for achieving certain grades, so of course Anthony asked if we would do the same for him. After thinking about it for about a second, I firmly said no. I didn’t say it to be an evil mother, but because I didn’t believe that I should bribe him to get good grades. He should want to get good grades for himself, and not because I was giving him money for doing so. It was his future that depended on the grades, so his motivation should be a personal and not a financial one.\nI’ve seen the same thing happen in the workplace, where we automatically throw money, or extrinsic motivation, at employees thinking it’s the best way to motivate them to act or behave in a certain way. I see four key problems with this approach:\n1. You can never force someone to be motivated.\nMotivation cannot be forced, it’s owned 100% by the individual. This may seem like common sense, but then why do so many companies throw money at employees? Do they think it will magically turn their motivation ‘switch’ on and make them work harder?\nI can tell you from experience that no matter how much money I dangle in front of my children, they’re not going to magically start like walking my dogs. Yes, they’ll go through the motions, but they own the decision as to when it turns from a task to a pleasure. And the same is true with our employees.\nOnly your employees can decide when they want to be motivated, you can’t.\n2. It can drive the wrong behaviours.\nWhen working for an office supply company, I was asked to look at the incentive program for delivery drivers. After spending a day on the road with them, I quickly saw that the current program, which was based solely on the speed of delivery, was, sorry for the pun, driving all the wrong behaviors.\nIt forced them to focus on doing whatever it took to get in and out, which was not only dangerous, but meant there was absolutely no customer service taking place for the drivers feared it would slow them down and thus they wouldn’t receive their incentive payment.\nThis example clearly shows the negative consequences financial motivators can have, and the impact they have on employees and on the business. So, think carefully before putting such programs in place, being aware up front of the behaviors they may encourage.\n3. It can kill creativity.\nOne of the best books written on this topic is “\nDrive\n” by Daniel Pink, and in it he talks about how extrinsic motivators such as incentives dull thinking, and thus blocks and kills creativity. He cites numerous studies which show evidence of this, proving that for work requiring creativity, this kind of motivation can indeed lead to poorer performance.\nWe need to ask ourselves, how important is creativity to the achievement of the results? If it is anything more than what Pink calls an “if-then” task, then instead of killing creativity you should really kill this kind of motivation approach.\n4. When is enough ever enough?\nAnd finally, the challenge you’ll face when using financial motivators is to figure out how to keep them attractive enough to continue motivating your employees. They may be motivational at the start, but trust me, soon the excitement will wear off and you’ll need to increase the financial value or change to something else.\nIf you need proof of this, just watch Frans de Waal’s “\nmonkey and cucumber\n” experiment, which shows what happens when one monkey’s reward is changed to a grape and the other is left with the original reward of a cucumber.\nSo before putting in place financial motivators, ask yourself if you’re willing to put up with constantly updating or changing what is given, for enough won’t be enough for long!\nSo in ending, let me say that if you love carrots like I do, put them in soups, put them in salads, give them to dogs as treats (my dogs love them), but don’t rely on them as motivation tools. Yes, they work for some jobs and some situations, but in the majority of situations in this new world of work, they cause more harm than they’re worth!\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "5 things holding us back from giving the ‘gift’ of feedback\nDebra Corey\nNov 19, 2019\n4 min read\nUpdated:\nApr 12\nI’d just spent ten days leading workshops on feedback, so you’d think I’d be the ‘queen’ of feedback, being able to give feedback freely and gloriously. But yet I found myself in the same situation as my students, asking myself – should I, do I really need to give  this feedback? My instructor voice shouted loudly out ‘yes’, but my human voice shouted back just as loudly ‘Hmm, I’m not quite sure’.\nWe all have these wobbles, these concerns as to whether feedback is worth the time and effort, the fear of saying it ‘right’ and it being received ‘right’. But that cannot and should not prevent us from giving it. For as I say in class over class, feedback is a gift that shows you care, helping each other be the best version of their self.”\nBut what’s holding us back from giving feedback? Here are five of the most common reasons I’ve heard (or have had myself):\n1. We believe others don’t want to receive feedback.\nWe often think that people don’t want to receive feedback, thinking of it as a punishment. And who’d want to be punished, right? Who’d want to hear if/when they’ve done something wrong, made a mistake, messed things up? The answer is, we all do! In fact, according to a\nstudy\nby Zenger and Folkman, 92% of respondents said they’d want to receive negative (redirecting) feedback, if delivered appropriately, as they felt it would improve their performance.\nWhen we talk about this concept in my workshops, I always have people share funny stories of when they’ve given or received feedback. This lightens the mood in the session and also makes feedback feel a bit more human. One attendee recently shared a story of how he left the house with toothpaste on his face, and it wasn’t until the end of the day that someone actually came up and told him, ouch! So yes, although it was a bit embarrassing for him to receive feedback that he had toothpaste on his face, he said he was happy that they did so. He only wished someone had done it sooner!\n2. We believe we don’t have the time to give feedback.\nIn this fast-paced world, I’m never surprised when I hear people say they don’t have enough time to give feedback. However, I always respond with the same question, which is, ‘do you have enough time to pick up the pieces if they don’t get your feedback and keep doing things wrong?’\n3. We believe it’s not our place (responsibility) to give feedback.\nWe often think that it’s not our place to give feedback, that it’s someone else’s responsibility. And do you know what, you may be right, it may be their boss’s or their boss’s boss. But does it really matter? If you see someone doing something that you feel they could learn from, why wait for someone else to deliver this feedback, this gift? Why shouldn’t you be the one delivering it?\nAs the expression goes, “It takes a village to raise a child”, and the same is true with feedback, for if we all give it, we will all learn and grow.\n4. We believe it will ruin my relationship with the person.\nAnother common fear of giving feedback is of what it will do to your relationship with the person. I had this happen to me when I had to tell my videographer, someone I had worked with for years, that he had messed up a video shoot by cutting off half of the person’s head I was interviewing. Would he hate me? Would he say he would never work with me again? Possibly, but if I didn’t give the feedback he may make the same mistake again, which wasn’t good for me and it certainly wasn’t good for his professional reputation.\nIf we instead think of feedback as a way to actually strengthen our relationships, as they are built on trust and honesty, feedback will flow more naturally and more regularly.\n5. We believe we don’t have the skills to give feedback.\nLast, and certainly not least, is the fear of not having the skills to give feedback effectively. And while this may be true for many, like any skill, if you work on developing them you will improve and it will become more natural and easier to do.\nAnd if you want to learn more about mastering your skills of giving feedback, two of my favorite books on this topic are ‘Radical Candor’ by Kim Scott and ‘Daring Greatly’ by Brené Brown\nSo if you do find these fears holding you back, which let’s be honest does happen to us all from time to time, picture the two scenarios I shared of the person with toothpaste on their face or the person with half of their head cut off, and ask yourself if you really want the same to happen to this person? Instead, overcome your fears and give the gift of feedback . . . I know I will!\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "BrewDog’s evolution of benefits from dogs to unicorns to the environment\nDebra Corey\nMar 3, 2021\n2 min read\nBrewDog, an independent Scottish brewery and pub chain, has always been known as a pioneer when it comes to employee benefits. From providing employees with\npawternity leave\n- where employees receive a week of paid leave to spend time with a new puppy or rescue dog - to the\nunicorn fund\n- a profit sharing scheme where 10% of company profits are shared with their entire team each year - they have always been innovative with the benefits they provide to their employees.\nBut what makes them truly unique is the alignment of their benefits to the company’s mission, values (or what they call their charter) and culture. This was seen with pawternity leave as it aligns with their love of dogs (they were founded by two men and a dog), and with the unicorn fund, as it aligns with their commitment to their people.\nAnd their latest benefit is no different, aligning with their mission to “make the earth great again”, doing their part by being the world’s first carbon negative brewery. As they say on their website “Our carbon, is our our problem”, which is why they launched a series of unprecedented initiatives to remove carbon from the atmosphere and to help the fight against climate change.\n“Our senior leadership team had a real eye opener after attending a talk by Sir David Attenborough, and took the decision to do more, do it quicker and really make a difference” Karen Bates, People Director at BrewDog.\nSo, you ask, what kind of benefit could they possibly put in place to align with this mission? The answer this let me say that it is certainly something that is both unique and important, showing that\nbenefits can do more than benefit the employee, they can also benefit the planet.\nHere are the three parts of this benefit that is provided to their employees, or what they call their ‘Carbon Negative Crew’:\nThe first part is\ndouble offsetting\nthe pawprint (carbon footprint) of each crew member through gold standard carbon offset programmes that remove twice as much carbon from the air each year than what the team is responsible for. They’re doing this through a partnership with a company called ‘Pawprint’, who have an online tool that helps crew members measure, understand and reduce their carbon footprint.\nNext, because as Bates says “we want to do it in a very BrewDog way”, they also double offset the pawprint of their crew’s dogs.\nAnd finally, they launched a\nsustainability suggestion scheme\nwhere any suggestion that is implemented is entitled to double unicorn points through their unicorn fund.\n“We want to set a new standard for sustainability and be a catalyst for the change that our world so badly needs” James Watt, CEO BrewDog.\nThis benefit truly shows BrewDog’s commitment to their mission, to their belief to “\nshow that business can be a force for good\n”, and to their people. It transcends traditional benefits, one that I for one applaud and can’t wait to see more of in the future.\nBenefits",

    "content": "How managers should ‘stop, look and listen’ with employee recognition\nDebra Corey\nJul 29, 2019\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nDec 19, 2020\nAs children we are told to Stop, Look and Listen before crossing the road, teaching us important lessons about safety. This same approach can and should be applied when it comes to recognition, teaching managers important lessons that will protect your company by engaging and retaining your critical talent.\nStep 1: Stop\nThe first step for managers is to stop – stop what they’re doing and understand why recognition is important. If they don’t, trust me, they’ll never embrace recognition, thinking it’s a waste of their time.\nHere’s some data to share with them to convince them of the power of recognition, and the difference it can make to improve business metrics, have employees work harder, and reduce turnover.\nOrganizations where recognition occurs have 14% better employee engagement, productivity and customer service than those without – Bersin by Deloitte.\n69% of employees said they would work harder if they felt their efforts were better appreciated – Socialcast.\nAlmost half of employees said they would leave a company that didn’t praise or thank them enough for the work they did – Reward Gateway.\nAnd if data isn’t enough to do the job, here’s a great\nblog\nwritten by my friend Alexandra Powell titled ‘How to turn a recognition skeptic into a believer’ that can give you some more tips.\nStep 2: Look\nGreat, you’ve gotten past the hurdle of your managers knowing why recognition is important. But what about helping them understand how and when to recognize? What I’ve seen happen time and time again is that managers wait for recognition moments to magically appear in front of them, and only then do they recognize their employees. This can cause huge problems because they end up recognizing either the wrong moments, or miss the important ones.\nThis generally leads to recognizing those that are the obvious, or easily seen moments (e.g. someone does a great job organizing and running a team party), or the loudest moments (e.g. to those employees who shout the loudest about the great work that they’ve done).\nAccording to a Reward Gateway\nstudy\n, 45% of employees feel that their manager unfairly rewards certain people over others.\nIf instead, managers would proactively look for recognition moments, looking as I like to say ‘in all directions’. Suggest that they picture themselves having eyes not just in the front, but on the sides and back of their head (sort of like one of those friendly monsters in the movie ‘Monsters Inc.’) By doing this, you’re able to see things in all directions, not just being able to see what’s directly in front of you.\nStep 3: Listen\nLast, but certainly not least, is to listen. When it comes to road safety, this step involves listening for cars, trains, etc., any form of danger. For recognition, there is an element of listening for danger signs, e.g. managers listening for signs that employees don’t feel recognition is being done well, but there’s also an element of active listening, so not just looking, but listening for recognition moments.\nWhat I mean by this is that managers are not the only ones who can (or should) look for recognition moments. There are others all around them that need to be doing this as well, making sure that there are many eyes and ears focused on this important process.\nAsk other employees on your team to be on the lookout for recognition moments, other managers, anyone and everyone that interacts with your team. By doing this you are creating a culture of continuous recognition, and also making sure that you don’t miss these important recognition moments.\nAnd in case you want data to support these points, here are two more pieces of useful data:\n75% of employees receiving at least monthly recognition, even informal, are satisfied with their job – BambooHR\nPeer-to-peer recognition is 35.7% more likely to have a positive impact on financial results than manager-only recognition – SHRM.\nSo please share this with your managers and/or anyone else in your company who you feel this would help. Together, we can remove the dangers of recognition that isn’t done well and make sure that all our employees feel valued and appreciated, and do their best for your company.\nRecognition",

    "content": "A recognition journey - Verifile’s approach to introducing recognition\nDebra Corey\nApr 4, 2023\n4 min read\nUpdated:\nMar 2\nVerifile, a company that provides global resume verification and background screening services, is on a journey. A journey to expand their business globally, and a journey to expand their people offering through their EVP and people strategy. “Since joining the company 18 months ago, we’ve focused on putting the foundations in place, creating a place where our people feel even more valued and appreciated,” says Fiona Buchanan, Chief People Officer.\nThey started with pay, benefits and wellbeing, putting new programs in place, and most recently have focused on recognition. This was done based on feedback from employees saying they felt it was an area for improvement and because the only recognition program in place was for long service, which although a generous program, only impacted a small number of their workforce.\n“We wanted to redirect recognition, focusing our efforts on all the good things and extra effort that our people are putting in, and not just on how long a small number of our people have been in the business. We also wanted recognition to be more inclusive, social and to create connections across the business” says Buchanan.\nAnother reason, and one that is more common following the pandemic, is as a way to bring people together. With more of their workforce working in hybrid patterns and remotely, and with the business growing globally, Verifile believes that recognition will be a great way to help their people feel a part of the organization, drive the desired culture and behaviors, and get to know one another better.\nVerifile’s approach to recognition is also a journey, starting by creating a culture of appreciation with the introduction of eCards, recognizing ‘everyday’ recognition. They did this for a few reasons. First, because they wanted to start with the basics, the ‘simple things' as Buchanan calls it - the thank yous, great jobs, the events in people's lives. And second, because they are in the process of reviewing and updating their company values, and thus want to wait to build other recognition programs around these when they’re launched in the future.\nThey involved their people in the development of the recognition eCards, giving them the opportunity to be heard and be a part of the process. Starting with a few basic eCards, they then went out to their workforce to suggest new ones and ultimately vote on the five cards to be included in the initial launch.\n“My favorite eCard is the one saying “You have the right to look smug,” which was suggested by Ben Taylor, Team Leader, as it really made us laugh! Outside of that though, it talked about our focus on quality, getting to the final result by working on a problem, passing it onto another team, and finally cracking it. It’s about pride in what the team accomplished and having a bit of fun with it,” says Fiona Furman, Internal Communications and Engagement Manager.\nBy the way, Ben is so proud of his suggested eCard that he’s made it his background for virtual calls and admitted “Getting my suggested card onto the VeriHub made me feel . . . pretty smug!”\nHere are some of the other eCards included in the initial launch:\nThe initial reaction has been fantastic, with employees using and loving their unique recognition eCards. Their journey will continue as they review and create new eCards along with the help of their people, and as they introduce additional elements of their recognition program once their values have been finalized. Together, this will help them achieve their objective of creating a place where their people truly feel valued and appreciated.\nTo end, let me share a few tips from Verifile’s story:\nFirst,\nyou don’t have to wait until everything is in place to begin your recognition and appreciation journey\n. Verifile could have waited until their values were finalized to introduce recognition, but instead decided that it was important to begin their journey now, laying the foundation for recognition, and starting to create a culture of appreciation.\nNext, it’s important to\ninvolve your people throughout your recognition journey\n, gaining their insights and also their buy-in. And as an extra bonus, they’ll help you come up with those special ideas that you may never have thought of yourself (e.g. the ‘You have the right to be smug’ eCard).\nAnd finally, keep in mind that\nrecognition can be an important part of supporting and/or changing your company culture\n.

    "content": "First Bus’s approach to driving recognition their own way\nDebra Corey\nJun 17, 2024\n4 min read\nUpdated:\nJun 18, 2024\nFirst Bus, the UK’s leading bus operator, is on a massive transformation journey, changing the culture for their 13,000 employees working across the UK and Ireland. Key to this is listening to their employees, gaining their perspectives and insights through vehicles such as an employee engagement survey.\nOne thing that’s become clear is employees would like more recognition and to feel appreciated. First Bus listened and created a recognition awards evening titled ‘Our Way’ Awards, which was held in London in April 2024.\nAccording to Rachel Alderson, Employee Engagement Lead, ”We wanted to address colleagues ‘feeling unappreciated’ which is the highest scoring emotion on the Employee Engagement survey and embed ‘Our Way’ values further into the business. It was an opportunity to celebrate success with our people to give them the recognition they deserve.”\nIn this blog I’d like to share some of the things that First Bus did to show their commitment to creating an event that delivers what I call the ‘appreciation feeling,’ and at the same time, supports and showcases the new culture they are striving for.\nInclusive nomination process\nFor many companies, the nomination process is quite straightforward. You send out an email and/or post something on your company intranet, and bang, you get tons of nominations. But with 90% of their workforce being bus drivers, not being in an office or in front of a computer, this just wouldn’t work.\nSo instead, their nomination process involved having each of their senior leaders across the different business units own the process. By doing this, they made sure that they had an inclusive approach, one where every group of employees was represented, and given the opportunity to be recognised.\nCreated a new recognition award category\nAt the start of the process there were four recognition award categories to align with their four values - Always Care, Do What’s Right - Succeed Together - Shape the Future. However, as the nominations started coming in they found that there were some amazing ones focusing on heroic actions, employees saving lives while going about their day-to-day activities. Because of this, they decided to create a new category, one recognising and celebrating these heroic contributions.\n“We decided that these deserved to stand on their own due to the impact they’ve had on our customer’s lives. It was the last award given on the night, and it had a huge impact on everyone in the room” said Alderson. I love this as it shows the importance of being flexible and adaptable as you design and deliver your recognition programmes. And it was such a success that it will continue to be a category in future years.\nMade everyone feel like a winner\nOften what happens at award events is that the only people who feel like winners are those that ultimately win the awards. However, the First Bus team organised an event where everyone felt like a winner, where they all left feeling great. From the bar of chocolate with a congratulations message waiting for them at their table, to the band that got everyone up and dancing throughout the night, to having senior leadership team hosts at each table so there would be someone that they knew, they thought of the little things to make the night feel special to everyone attending.\n“The focus wasn’t just on the recognition awards, we wanted to make it great for everyone. For many of our employees they had never attended an event like this, so we did our best to make them feel comfortable and to have fun whether they won or not” said Alderson.\nThought of the little things\nI’ve already shared some of the little but important things the First Bus team did when organising and running the event, but one more example has to do with the awards that were given.\nWinners received two things - a trophy and a gift. The trophy was made of recyclable materials, which aligns with their mission to protect the planet. And the gift was a voucher, which aligns with their focus on diversity, giving employees the choice to select the gift that is right for them. These show their commitment and alignment to what matters most, sending a message to their employees that what they talk about are not just words, but actions, and, going back to what I said at the beginning, that they were being listened to.\nLet me end by sharing what Rachel put on LinkedIn about this event, which is where I first heard about it. I think it sums up the impact and difference it made to their people. Congratulations to Rachel and the team at First Bus, they did a fantastic job with this event and with the other things they’re doing to drive and deliver the appreciation feeling (sorry, I couldn’t resist throwing in a pun 😂).\n“Recognition is key to making people feel engaged and helps drive a culture where people feel valued, a sense of belonging and proud to work for you. A small thing, but so powerful. 💥 It’s human nature to smile when you see others smiling, and there was lots of people revelling in the joy of others winning - true team spirit right there!”\nPlease\ncontact me\nif you'd like to discuss how you can create innovative and effective recognition programs at your company.\nRecognition",

    "content": "Dig Deeper: What Archaeology Can Teach Us About Empathy & Compassion\nDebra Corey\n2 days ago\n3 min read\nIn the rush of daily deadlines, back-to-back meetings, and overflowing to-do lists, it’s easy to focus only on what’s visible - the behaviours, the performance, the things right in front of us.\nBut what if the key to stronger leadership and deeper connection with your people lies beneath the surface?\nIn this edition, we’re digging into two powerful building blocks from our Great Boss Building Block Model™ - Empathy and Compassion - and exploring how they can transform how we lead. And we’ll do it through an unusual but meaningful lens: the world of the archaeologist.\nJust like archaeologists, great leaders take time to uncover what’s hidden, understand the full story, and act with care.\n4 Ways to Lead Like an Archaeologist\n1. Curiosity Without Judgment\nArchaeologists approach every dig with curiosity, not assumptions. They seek to understand how people lived - not to judge or label it as right or wrong.\nLeadership takeaway:\nEmpathy starts with curiosity. Ask, “What’s behind this behaviour?” instead of rushing to conclusions. Suspend judgment and lean into understanding.\n2. Uncover Hidden Layers\nThe best archaeologists don’t go in with heavy tools. They use delicate brushes and work with care, revealing layers of meaning and context without causing harm.\nLeadership takeaway:\nEmpathy and compassion mean going deeper. Don’t just react to surface actions and behaviours - take time to uncover what someone might be feeling or experiencing underneath. Respond with patience and care.\n3. Piece Together the Bigger Picture\nFinds are rarely whole. Archaeologists often work with fragments, slowly piecing them together to form the bigger artifact or story.\nLeadership takeaway:\nPeople are the same. To truly support someone, you have to connect the dots - history, stressors, context. Compassionate leaders look beyond isolated moments to see the full person and situation.\n4. Respect Different Cultures and Stories\nArchaeologists don’t impose their worldview. They approach different cultures and time periods with respect, seeking to understand stories on their own terms.\nLeadership takeaway:\nAs Brené Brown says, “Empathy has no script. There is no right way or wrong way to do it. It’s simply listening, holding space, withholding judgment.” And crucially, she also says we can never fully get into someone else’s shoes - but we can try to understand what it’s like to walk in them.\nCompassionate leaders honour those differences and respond in ways that acknowledge who people truly are, not acting based on what we assume they want and need. They don’t need to have lived the same experience to treat it with care, dignity, and support.\nYour Leadership Reflection\nNext time you face a moment that calls for empathy or compassion, pause and ask: What might I discover if I led like an archaeologist - with curiosity, care, and the desire to truly understand?\nBe the archaeologist of someone’s experience. Dig deeper. Uncover the truth. Treat every layer with care.\nDIY Leadership Development Tool\nDo you or your leaders need a boost when it comes to leading with empathy and compassion?\nYou’re not alone. Even experienced managers can struggle to lead with empathy and compassion - especially under pressure. That’s why we created our\nEmpathy & Compassion Compassion Card Challenge,\npart of our new DIY Leadership Development tools.\nIt’s\npractical\n,\npowerful\n, and\nreasonably priced\n- making it accessible for any business or leader ready to grow.\nThis pair-based activity puts participants in real-world scenarios where they practise making thoughtful, effective choices - building the confidence and capability to lead with empathy, act with compassion, and make a real impact.\n👉 Click\nhere\nto learn more and start building this essential leadership skill today.\nTags:\nLeadership\nEmpathy\nCompassion\nLeadership",

    "content": "5 tips for connecting the dots for hybrid working\nDebra Corey\nApr 5, 2022\n6 min read\nUpdated:\nMay 4, 2023\nThroughout the pandemic we’ve had no choice but to address what I call the ‘dots’ of hybrid working, meaning the individual challenges and/or obstacles that we’ve had to face. From figuring out how to get our people set up to work from home, to figuring out how to bring them safely back to the workplace, we’ve had lots of dots, moving and changing over and over again.\nBut as we’re now in a place where we know that hybrid work is here to stay, it’s time to pause for a moment and start looking at and addressing it differently. It’s time to connect the dots, making sure that all of the individual dots together create the hybrid working ‘picture’ that’s right for you - helping you attract, retain and engage your people, and helping your business be productive and responsive to further change challenges.\n“A well-executed hybrid workplace can be a magnet that brings people together and helps us work better than ever before” - Jim Keane and Todd Heiser, Harvard Business Review blog titled ‘4 Strategies for Building a Hybrid Workplace that Works.’\nThe first step is to determine your end ‘picture’ by reimagining how you want hybrid working to look, feel and ultimately work at your company. As you do this, it’s important to take into consideration your company’s mission and values, the culture you want to create and/or maintain, and the needs of your people so that you end up with a picture that meets all of these objectives.\nThe next step is to determine the individual ‘dots’ required to create this overall picture when you connect them. As you do this, it’s important to understand which ones you’ll need to add, those that need to be removed, and any that may need to be changed. Consider anything and everything, from how you communicate with your people, to how they work together, to how you engage with them, make sure that no dot is missed that could have an impact on the overall hybrid working experience.\nOnce you do this, you’re set up to connect the dots, having an end-to-end and holistic approach to hybrid working. And to help you as you go through these steps, here are five tips:\n1. Don’t just recreate existing practises\nWhen we were first forced to work from home at the start of COVID-19, we had no choice but to recreate the office online. We leveraged existing technology and quickly added new ones that would help our employees do their jobs remotely. Great in the middle of a pandemic, but there are two problems with this long term. First, it assumes that everything we did before was worth recreating, and second, it assumes that what worked in an office would automatically work remotely.\nFor these reasons, when we reimagine hybrid working we need to resist recreating existing practises, taking a step back and looking at and for opportunities to redesign how work is done. By doing this, we have a better chance of meeting the new requirements of hybrid working, and in some situations, creating something better than it was in the past.\nAn example relates to how we manage meetings with a hybrid workforce. In the past, we’d have one or maybe two people that couldn’t make a meeting in person, so we’d dig out the conference call phone, or connect them through videoconferencing technology. Either way, it didn’t work, with the person being forgotten or ignored as they weren’t in the room. Companies are taking some interesting approaches to overcoming these challenges and redesigning new ways of holding meetings. From everyone bringing their laptop to the meeting room or taking the meeting from their desks to even things out, or having empty chairs with the person’s name (or even photo) on the chair so you don’t forget them, they’re finding ways that recreate the situation to achieve their desired outcomes.\nAccording to Alex Hirst, Co-founder of Hoxby Collective, and someone who campaigns for individual's setting their own workstyle and is a pioneer of asynchronous working, \"Companies need to unlearn corporate behaviours, with successful ‘async’ working requiring a cultural change. We need to encourage employees to communicate when and how they work, by broadcasting working hours on profile pages, in email signatures or Slack status messages. We need to upskill management to lead by example and work asynchronously too. And, we need to encourage a culture where people are judged on their outputs rather than their presenteeism.\"\n2. Imagine the impossible\nBuilding on from the previous point, it’s important that as you recreate and reimagine hybrid working at your company, you challenge yourself and others to imagine the impossible. Leading with your strategy, objectives and ‘picture’, get out that blank piece of paper and come up with alternative ways of doing things. It’s something you’ve been doing for the last two years, so it’s what will be expected and required going forward.\nAn example is how companies are challenging traditional working practises and patterns that support hybrid working. From moving away from traditional nine to five working hours, to letting employees work from anywhere, to moving to four day work weeks, companies are doing things now that were unheard of (and unimaginable) a few years ago.\n3. Be on the lookout for obstacles\nAn important thing to keep in mind as you go through these steps are the obstacles, which are things that could trip your company or people up. For example, if you mandate that all employees must come into the office two days a week, consider what obstacles this will cause for working parents who over the last two years have adjusted their work schedule so that they can take their children to school. Or, what about employees who share a house and would have to work in their bedroom for three days a week? Put on your diversity and inclusion lens, and make sure that your dots don’t favour one group of employees over another, creating a hybrid working picture that works for everyone.\n4. Understand the changing needs of your workforce\nWhen reimagining your hybrid working ‘picture’ and determining your ‘dots’, it’s absolutely critical to understand the changing needs of your workforce. Many companies have done a fantastic job with this, going out to their people and asking them how they believe hybrid working will impact their work and personal lives, and what they need to change to better meet their needs. Take the time to ask these questions, and then use this powerful information to put yourself in your people’s shoes as you reimagine how work will get done moving forward.\nAn example is a company who adapted one of their recognition practises to work more effectively for a hybrid workforce. In the past, when an employee would win a recognition award they’d surprise them with balloons at their desk. It was a great way to showcase their achievement and celebrate with colleagues in the office. But as they moved to hybrid working, they heard from their people that this wasn’t working, that often they wouldn’t know they had won an award for days as they weren’t in the office, or that they had missed out on celebrating with colleagues since  they hadn’t been in the office. The result was to move to an online digital recognition platform so that all employees, regardless of where they worked, could feel recognised and get involved with the recognition even more so than in the past.\n5. Continually review and refresh your approach\nLast, but certainly not least, is to review and refresh your hybrid working ‘picture’ and ‘dots’ over and over again. Speak to your people, understand what’s working and what’s not working, measure engagement and effectiveness, and ultimately determine if what you’re doing meets the changing needs of your business, people and what is on offer to support hybrid working. Whether it’s how you run meetings, manage projects, hold company-wide events, manage work schedules or communicate with your people, constantly have a pulse on how effective they are.\nLet me end by encouraging you to take these steps to connect the dots of hybrid working at your organisation. And, as Mohith Agadi said, “If you can’t connect the dots, find the right dots”, finding and addressing ones that are right for your company and people now and in the future.\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "Growing as they go: How HiBob is developing its people programs\nDebra Corey\nMar 7, 2023\n4 min read\nAs the world of work continues to change, every company is on a quest to find new ways to support their people, helping them adapt and adjust to the new ways and challenges they bring. For some companies, this means embracing the change, using it as time for experimentation and innovation. These companies, these rebels as I call them, are intentional and strategic in their approach, not letting traditional ways prevent them from meeting the changing needs of their people and businesses.\nThis is especially true when it comes to decisions impacting how, where and when our people work, with companies experimenting with new ways to combine and blend work in and out of the office. From remote work to hybrid work to anywhere work to 4-day workweeks, we’re seeing companies experimenting with what will enable their people and business to “be their best,” and at the same time stay competitive.\nAt HiBob, a global HR technology provider, it’s no different. Their 743 employees (or what they call “bobbers”) are not only learning how to adapt to this new world of work, but they’re learning how to work in a growing and more global business, one that supports their increasing number of clients from around the world.\nThe HiBob people team approached these challenges in the same way they address their technology and clients, leaning into and living through their company values.\nAs I spoke with Toby Hough, People & Culture Director EMEA, two of these values were front and center as he described the new programs and changes they’ve put in place.\n1. The first is their value\nBuild the exceptional,\nwhich talks about the concept of being trailblazers, having a mindset and approach that ticks the three boxes of functional, flexible and fun.\nThis means that they’re not afraid to try new things, ones that may not be done in other organizations, but worth giving it a go at HiBob. “Everyone contributes to building the exceptional at HiBob. From our constant platform development, growing into new geographies, innovating with new practices and processes, to building amazing relationships with our colleagues and customers” says Hough.\n2. The second is\nGrow through what we do through\n, which talks about building the exceptional in an ever-changing environment, recognizing that not every day will be a good day or an easy one, where you need to be agile and adapt.\nThis means they see every challenge and experience as a way to learn, improve, and remain resilient. They see things as a journey, one where there are constant iterations, evolving what and how they do things to meet the changing needs of their people and business.\n“In our HR team, ‘grow through what we go through’ means we must be willing to pilot and experiment, and be humble enough to say to the business ‘this didn’t work’ or ‘this needs changing’”. And of course this means listening to our bobbers, understanding their changing needs” says Hough.\nNow that I’ve shared HiBob’s approach to their change strategy, let me share just two of the programs they’ve put in place.\n1. Work from Anywhere program\nMore and more companies are looking for ways to build freedom into the workplace, giving their people the freedom to decide where and when they want to work. My favorite quote that I believe sums this up is “Work isn’t where you go, it’s what you do.”\nAt HiBob, in addition to a hybrid approach to work, they’ve also put in place their Work from Anywhere program. It was put in place based on a need to support their people in visiting and reconnecting with their family once the COVID-19 lockdown rules were removed, and could be taken for up to two months. As time went on, two changes were made as follows: The first is the reason, with more and more requests being made as a way to combine a desire to travel with the ability to continue to work. And second, while bobbers can still go away for up to two months per year, it should be in maximum one month blocks. They made this change as they found that as a business bobbers being away for a solid two months was getting in the way of the natural rhythm of coming together in person as teams.\n“We made this change to balance supporting our people in their love for travel and whilst listening to the needs of our teams to create meaningful connections together” says Hough.\n2. Balance days\nAs with any global company, especially one having people in seven countries working different time zones and work days, HiBob was facing the challenges associated with this. So based on feedback from their people, they put in place balance days as a way to support the wellbeing of all Bobbers globally.\nThe way it works is that at the end of each quarter, HiBob shuts down for a day with clear instructions that there will be no meetings, no messages, no notifications! It’s a time to completely disconnect and switch off, a time to refresh, relax and rejuvenate. And since everyone is doing it at the same time, bobbers don’t have to stress and play catchup.\nThey had an interesting learning when piloting this in 2022. Originally they had decided not to have a balance day in January at the end of the quarter as they didn’t think it was necessary since people were coming back from the holidays. However, in listening to their people they found that the stress of their biggest quarter of the year, kicking off the new year with new targets and goals, and the stress of  holiday backlog actually made it a critical time to have this wellbeing-focused day at the end of the month. Another example of grow through what we go through in action for the HR team.\nLet me end by thanking Toby for sharing how they’re supporting their people at HiBob. These are great examples of a commitment to delivering on their mission to “change the world of work forever” one meaningful day and one meaningful action at a time.\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "What happens when six rebels go out for dinner?\nDebra Corey\nMar 26, 2018\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nDec 19, 2020\nWhat happens when you get six HR rebels together for dinner? Well, let’s just say that these rebels don’t just challenge the status quo at work, but outside of work as well.  It was such an eventful evening that the group have named it “steakgate”. Interested? Well, read on to hear what happened.\nThe story takes place at a very nice restaurant in downtown Sydney, Australia, where we were together to celebrate the release of our new book, ‘Build it: A rebel playbook for employee engagement’. Everyone attending was a rebel, as they had contributed to the book in some way.\nSo onto the story, which began when our waiter came over to take our food orders.  Sally asked him a very simple question – “What is the difference in taste between a steak that is aged 36 months versus 60 months?”  The waiter responded by saying that he would recommend the 36-month-old steak because women’s palettes are different from men’s, and from his experience women just don’t like the 60-month-old steak.\nWith this one sentence, our waiter, despite being well-intentioned, stunned an entire group into silence.  We couldn’t believe, as Denise Hanlon said, that “steak was gender-specific”. So although the group had just met that night, we rallied together to wrong the right and help the waiter understand why his behavior was inappropriate so he would not offend someone again in the future.\n“The poor waiter didn’t realize he was with a bunch of HR rebels who would all advocate for gender equality” Kylie Green\nWhat happened next had two parts, the soft approach, and the more in-your-face approach.  Let’s start with the soft approach, which is when we encouraged Sally to explain to the waiter how his behavior had made her feel and went on to suggest an alternative approach in the future.\n“He listened, but no giant light bulb appeared above his head. It also didn’t lessen the irritation that we had faced such an obvious case of unconscious bias and not dealth with it fully.” Mat Lawrence\nFeeling as if we couldn’t or shouldn’t let this go – we are rebels don’t you know – we decided to move onto the next step.  So when the waiter stopped by to take our dessert orders we encouraged Matt to ask him – “Which desserts were for men and which were for women?” The waiter walked away with his head held low, clearly upset, and we wondered what would happen next as he went to talk to a colleague.\nHe then completely earned our respect by having the courage to come back and apologize for his original gender comment, saying how he had been wrong.  We accepted his apology and then apologized to him for making a joke of the situation and hurting his feelings, ending with a heartfelt handshake.\nSo did we go far?  Should we have left it alone after the first part?  After discussing this over coffee – we decided against ordering dessert – we all agreed that the answer was yes.  For although it was a bit difficult and uncomfortable for everyone involved, we got to where we needed to be with a more educated and sensitive waiter who we are 100% confident will never do this again.\n“I think the real highlight was giving the waiter direct and honest feedback, to the point that he understood clearly and was very apologetic. I don’t think he will do that again to another customer, so I think that’s a very positive outcome!” Mathew Paine\nThe lessons for us, and that I wanted to share with you, are first, change often requires taking multiple steps – some which can be easy and others which can be more challenging and take you out of your comfort zone.\nBut that’s fine, because if we truly want to challenge the status quo and make a difference, we need to be rebels, and we need to be brave and take action. Second, if we work together as a team, a team of rebels, we can support and encourage each other – for together we can make the difference and make the change that needs to happen.\nLet me end by saying that I look forward to a reunion dinner with my new group of Australian rebels, who are Matt Lawrence, Mathew Paine, Sally Park, Denise Hanlon and Kylie Green. I’m not sure if it will be at the same restaurant, or maybe we’ll bring our rebelliousness to another one. Watch this space!\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "Seven tips for using social connections to support employee wellbeing\nDebra Corey\nOct 8, 2020\n4 min read\nThroughout the pandemic, companies have been doing their absolute best to replace ‘water cooler’ moments with virtual social connections. But have you ever wondered why these moments are so important? The key is to consider employee wellbeing.\nIs it because they help us to keep up with the latest gossip and have a laugh? or is there more to them? Well, research has shown that social connections improve physical health and psychological wellbeing, which means that they’re right up there with eating your veggies, working out, and getting a proper night’s sleep.\nDr. Emma Seppala, Science Director, Stanford Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education, said: “People who feel more connected to others have lower levels of anxiety and depression, have higher self-esteem, greater empathy for others, are more trusting and cooperative and, as a consequence, others are more open to trusting and cooperating with them. In other words, social connectedness generates a positive feedback loop of social, emotional and physical well-being.”\nAnd on the flip side, one study showed that a lack of social connection is a greater detriment to health than obesity, smoking, and high blood pressure.\nSo how do you improve employee wellbeing with social connections and benefit from these positive impacts? Here are seven tops tips, in addition to some examples from my own conversations with companies that I conducted when researching and writing my recent eBook.\nTip 1 – Start with why employee engagement matters\nThe first question you should ask yourself before rolling out any program is ‘why?’ – why do businesses and employees want and need these connections? Is it to achieve a business objective? is it to improve cooperation between team members? Or is it just to have a bit of fun? If you start by answering this question, you’ll have a better chance of having the social connections tick the box, and achieve your objectives.\nTip 2 – Have something for everyone\nThe next thing to consider is your audience. Often, we create these programs to meet the needs of one group or the employees that shout the loudest. And while we certainly want to meet their needs, it’s important to hear all voices and design programs around the diverse needs of our entire workforce. For example, consider those that may not be comfortable with certain activities or competitions, and find ways where they do feel comfortable, and can therefore reap the benefits of social connections.\nTip 3 – Consider different types of connections\nBesides organizing different activities, it’s just as important to consider the different types of connections. For example, what can you do to support connections at a 1:1 level, team level, group level or company-wide level? Each of these are required for different reasons and should be considered as you’re developing your connection programs.\nFor example, one company I interviewed is randomly linking people up to have 1:1 meetings via Slack. This not only creates connections that help employee wellbeing, but gives employees the opportunity to meet and create relationships with people they may not have known in the past.\nTip 4 – Don’t do it alone\nOver the years I’ve learned that some of ‘my’ best ideas are those that have come from others, which means that when it comes to innovating, I leverage the combined creativity of my entire organization. Whether it’s bringing in a committee to help you, or conducting pulse surveys to ask your entire workforce for input, if you bring your employees into the process, the results will be much better.\nAnd it’s not just the ideas that should be leveraged from others, but running the social connection programs themselves. Many companies I’ve spoken to use their employees, and their many talents and passions, to lead some of their events.\nFor example, one company I interviewed told me about a ‘cleaning hour challenge’ that was organized and run by some of their employees who were obsessed with cleaning. Each week they shared cleaning tips and ran a challenge to get everyone involved.\nAnother example is a company that ran a ‘how to have a holiday at home’ webinar series, helping their employees make the most of staycations. Ideas were presented by different employees, ranging from having a camping holiday in your garden to a virtual safari tour.\nTip 5 – Trial and error\nAnother thing I’ve learned over the years is the power of trial and error, especially when it comes to things like social connections. For example, one company I interviewed told me that at the start of the pandemic they sent every employee a jump rope, with the idea that they would do virtual jump rope sessions. However, when they discovered that the idea fell a little flat, they quickly scrapped it and moved onto something else.\nSo, don’t get too precious about programs. If they work, continue them, and if they don’t, move (or jump) on!\nTip 6 – Involve families in employee wellbeing\nDuring lockdown, many companies have invited family members into social connections for the first time. This has been beneficial in that it helps meet social connection needs, encourages employees to participate when they may not have done so otherwise, and even improves employee engagement as family members are seeing the benefits of the employee working at the company.\nFor example, one company ran an initiative called ‘Pinot and Picasso’, where employees and family members came together for Pinot (wine) and Picasso (painting lessons). Another company held a coloring competition for the children of their employees, asking them to create a poster about the topic of washing your hands that would be hung up in the office toilets.\nTip 7 – Involve managers in employee wellbeing\nLast, and certainly not least, is to stress the importance of managers when it comes to social connections. The more they can get involved with the connection activities, role modeling it to others, the better chance you have of your workforce engaging.\nWhether it’s leading an activity or merely being a participant, encourage them to have an active role in activities as well as 1:1 social connections with their team. And if they don’t believe it’s important, share with them the benefits I listed at the start of this blog.\nI hope these tips help you as you continue to develop and roll out social connection programs at your company. And don’t forget, they’re just as important as eating your veggies, so get out there and do it!\nThis blog was originally posted on\nHRD Connect\n.\nWellbeing",

    "content": "How does employee engagement really feel?\nDebra Corey\nAug 4, 2018\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nDec 19, 2020\nWe’ve all heard it before – if you’re committed to a cause, if you’re engaged with it, you’ll go that extra mile for it. But what does that really mean?\nI’m a hard worker, surely I go the extra mile day in and day out, right? Yes and no. Yes, I work hard, and yes I put in a lot of effort, but no, that isn’t necessarily commitment or engagement.\nI didn’t truly understand this until I was writing my\nlatest book\n, and I saw and felt commitment and engagement in a different way.  Let me start from the beginning to explain this. . . .\nGlenn, my co-author, and I decided to divide responsibilities for writing the book. He was going to own the core parts of each chapter, and I was going to own what we call in the book, plays. Each play would be a story about how a company acted as a rebel against each of the ten elements of our engagement bridge model. Simple, right? I “just” find great engagement stories, contact the HR person, and they quickly and easily say yes to an interview.\nFor a small percentage of the sixty plays in the book it happened this way, but for the majority of them it was anything but this. Instead for six months I stalked, I chased and I harassed my fellow HR professionals, asking them time and time again if I could interview them. So much so that I’m actually surprised that no one contacted the police to get a restraining order to keep me away from them!\nBut this didn’t stop me. I continued to go after them, writing to them, or in many cases, chasing after them as they got off the stage from speaking at a conference or HR event.\nIf you don’t believe me, just ask Josh Bersin who I stalked not only at a conference in Australia but in the UK to the point that he said he should probably agree to an interview so that I didn’t chase him in yet another continent. And, by the way, his interview wasn’t even for a play, it was for a bonus interview on our book’s website, so you can imagine my chasing for the actual plays.\nSo why am I telling you this, and what does this have to do with commitment and engagement? T0 answer this let me tell you a little bit about myself.\nI am a strong-willed, confident HR professional.  I have no problem presenting to Boards, and I have no problem (and absolutely love) speaking at events around the world. But what is completely outside of my comfort zone is having to ask complete strangers for help. I’ll walk around lost so that I don’t have to bother someone for directions. I’ll stand on a shelf at the supermarket to reach the top items so that I don’t have to take someone away from their own shopping.\nSo how in the world did I get the courage and have the energy for six months to get outside of my comfort zone? How did I manage to get sixty amazing rebels (and another twenty or so bonus interviews with people like Josh) to agree to helping me out?\nSimple, I was 100% committed to my cause and my purpose, which was writing “the” best book that we could. I didn’t want to let Glenn down and I didn’t want to let my future readers down, so I put aside any fears, reservations and insecurities that I had and went out there and “just” got the job done.\nTo me, this sums up what commitment and engagement is, and at the same time, explains why it’s so critical for our organizations.\nIf our businesses are going to not only survive but thrive, we need people like this who are going to go that extra mile.They, and only they, will innovate more, will provide better customer service, and will do whatever it takes to help our companies succeed.\nEasy right? Well as with my story, nothing is easy.But as with our book, which is already helping thousands of my fellow HR professionals and business leaders, it’s well worth the effort, and bottom line, it feels great!\nTo get the first two chapters of our book, “Build it: A rebel playbook for employee engagement” for FREE, go to:\nrebelplaybook.com\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "Recognition according to the Cake Fairy\nDebra Corey\nAug 4, 2020\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nDec 19, 2020\nLet me share a little secret with you . . . my village has a fairy! And not just any fairy, but a cake fairy that bakes the most gorgeous cakes, and secretly delivers them to people in the village who’ve helped others throughout the pandemic, thanking and recognising them for their contributions or just if they need a pick-me-up!\nAnd although it’s a secret who the cake fairy actually is, I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to have a phone interview with her. In it, she shared with me her inspiration and tips on recognition. . . . here is what she had to say:\nQuestion: Why did you decide to become the cake fairy?\n🧚 I grew up in a village with a cake fairy, in fact we also had a flower fairy, beer fairy and crochet fairy. I was bemoaning the fact that I lived in a village without one, so in a lightbulb moment I thought to myself “If you want to live somewhere with a cake fairy, perhaps you should be the cake fairy”.\nAs time has gone on I realised that this also has a lot to do with my mum, who died in October, and who I miss dreadfully. Mum taught me to bake from as soon as I could stand on a chair next to her in the kitchen, and often we’d have massing baking sessions. It’s become a way of feeling close to her, honouring her memory and having something positive to focus on and distract me.\nQuestion: Why do you think it’s important to thank and recognise others?\n🧚 The world, especially now, can be a bit of a grim place, so if you can make people smile and be happy by recognising them, it can make such a difference.\nWhen I’m not being a cake fairy, I work at a hospital, where I do my best to recognise people for the work and contributions they make, especially those that don’t normally get the credit or attention, as they too make such a big difference.\nQuestion: Can you ever give too much recognition?\n🧚 Absolutely not. Just because you told someone they were fabulous one day, it doesn’t mean that if they’re fabulous again you shouldn’t tell them. It never hurts to hear it again, especially when life is tough and we all doubt ourselves from time to time.\nQuestion: Everyone gets cake and postcards, why?\n🧚 I give out cake because I love it, and I just assume that everyone else does. I give out handwritten postcards so that the person knows who’s recognised them and why, which is just as important as the cake. In fact, I don’t care if someone throws away the cake as long as they see the message of recognition.\nIt’s been lovely to see posts on the village Facebook page where people share the cakes and postcards they’ve received. I think it’s motivated people to say thank you more often to one another.\nQuestion: How does it make you feel to be the cake fairy?\n🧚 It gives me such a warm feeling to know that I am able to brighten the days of so many people in the village. Through such tough times, I’ve been able to make people smile. And, I love hearing all of the nominations and the brilliant things people are doing to help one another.\nI feel like it’s helping to make a kinder community that values its members.\nQuestion: Do you have a favourite story?\n🧚 The sweetest nominations have come from children, who have sent them to their friends who they’ve missed during lockdown, with messages such as “I can’t wait to play with you again”. It’s even more special as they believe in fairies, so there’s the magic behind it as well.\nAbout the author:\nDebra Corey is a highly experienced and award-winning HR leader, world-class speaker, three-time author, consultant, and was named one of the top 101 global employee engagement influencers.

    "content": "Why and how we should put ourselves in our employee's shoes\nDebra Corey\nJan 25, 2021\n4 min read\nWhen I met my adoptive daughter for the first time on an introductory visit, the first thing she did was ask if she could put on my shoes. She then proceeded to walk, well stumble as she wasn’t yet three years old, around in them for the remainder of our time together.\nAs I look back on this moment it makes me smile, but it also reminds me of the importance of putting ourselves in each other’s shoes. For my daughter, it was for a bit of fun, but I’m sure it was also about getting to know me better through wearing my shoes.\nIt’s this concept that I’d like to explore in this blog, looking at the benefits of putting ourselves in our employee’s shoes, and some things to keep in mind as we do it.\nLet me start by sharing three benefits of putting yourself in your employee’s shoes:\n1. Helps you understand\nWhen we understand our employees, we collect information and gain the power to better meet their needs. And in a world where our employee’s needs get more and more diverse and challenging every day,\nunderstanding is even more critical now than ever before\n.\nAnd when I think of this, I immediately think of the show “Undercover Boss”, where senior level executives slip anonymously into lower level jobs at their own company to find out what their employees really do, think, and how they get things done. I love watching this show, seeing how executives truly change as they gain this understanding, and as a result change how they as a leader act, and how their organization is run.\n2. Uncovers motivations\nIf understanding is the first layer of the process, then motivation is the second layer. This is where you not only understand what employees think and want, but you\nunderstand the motivations behind them.\nThere’s a phrase saying “\nBe kind, for everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about\n”. To me this talks about taking the time and putting in the extra effort when you’re in your employee’s shoes to understand their motivations.\nFor example, a company I spoke with explained that they were disappointed that their workforce was not joining the online exercise and meditation classes they had organized. When taking the time to understand their “battles”, they came to find out that employees were having these with their managers, as they were not supporting this initiative, sending the message that their employees really shouldn’t be taking time away from work for “silly classes”. By understanding this, the HR team could address the problem by helping managers see the benefits of the classes, supporting and encouraging their teams to join in.\n3. Shows you care\nAnd finally, putting yourself in your employee’s shoes shows them that you care. I can remember when I worked at a retailer, each year during the busy Christmas season we would all go and help out in the stores. By doing this we showed our employees that we knew how busy it was, and cared enough to come and help them.\nSimple act, huge impact!\nGreat, there’s benefits of putting yourself in your employee’s shoes. But since it’s not always easy to do, let me share four tips from lessons I’ve learned over the years:\nPut on the comfortable AND uncomfortable shoes\nI’m sure we’d all prefer putting on comfortable shoes, or in the case of our employees, speaking and being with employees who are more cooperative and engaging. But unlike uncomfortable shoes that cause blisters, uncomfortable employees actually give you a better chance of preventing “blisters'' in the design and delivery of your engagement programs. They’re the ones that won’t hesitate in raising those difficult points of views or perspectives, which in the end helps you see a clearer and more well-rounded picture of what’s going on and what to do. So get over your fears, and put them all on.\nHave others try on the shoes\nIf you’re the only person putting yourself in your employee’s shoes, I see two key problems. First, it gives you only one view, perspective or interpretation of the information. Second, from a buy-in perspective, you’ll only have one person bought into the information and thus doing something with it. So bring others into this important exercise, it’s good for them and for your company.\nListen to understand not to respond\nA common mistake we often make when we’re putting ourselves in other's shoes is to listen to respond, and not to listen to understand. As difficult as it can be, it’s important to enter the situation with no preconceived ideas, open to anything and everything we hear, truly listening and not waiting to jump in with your own ideas and recommendations. It may seem difficult at first, but I’ve found that when I do this it actually frees up more of my mind to  focus on the employee, and not on what I’m going to say or how I'll respond.\nBe empathetic versus sympathetic\nAnother common mistake many of us make when wearing our employee’s shoes is that we’re sympathetic versus empathetic. As Brené Brown explains  in this fabulous short\nvideo\ntitled “The Power of Empathy”, empathy “fuels connection” and sympathy “drives disconnection”. Since Brené explains it so much better than I could ever do, check out her 2 ½ minute\nvideo\nto hear more on this.\nIn ending, let me encourage you to put yourself in your employees shoes as a way to truly and genuinely understand, support and care for them. Whether it’s your own version of “Undercover Boss”, running focus groups and/or conducting surveys, find ways to do this and reap the benefits in return.\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "We pay people for more than their hands, right?\nDebra Corey\nOct 10, 2018\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nDec 19, 2020\nHave you ever heard someone say something so simple, so basic, but yet so profound? Well that’s exactly what happened the other day when Glenn and I were leading a workshop with a company’s line managers, having wonderful discussions about the critical role they have to play when it comes to employee engagement.\nWe were going through each of the ten elements of\nThe Engagement Bridge\n, a model we introduce in our book, and were on the topic of job design. The discussion centered around why and how we need to build autonomy into jobs, thus creating more purpose, meaning and ultimately engagement. Many of the managers led roles which are traditionally thought of as manual jobs, so I was prepared and braced for the pushback that I often receive when it comes to this topic.\nBut then one of the managers at the back of the room raised his hand and asked,\n“Don’t we pay people not just for their hands, but for their minds?”\nThere was a moment of silence, and again I braced myself for pushback, and then I looked around the room and everyone was shaking their head yes.\nWhy? Because the words this manager had said was so true!  We hire the entire person – the body, the mind, and the heart – so why shouldn’t we be doing whatever we can to get the most out of and engage with each and every part? Makes sense, right?  Then why do so many companies forget about this?\nWhy do they design jobs that focus solely on the body, the hands, the work that is manually being done? Why don’t they bring in the mind and heart to not only have our employees truly feel fulfilled, but to get the most out of them for the organization? What are they afraid of? What do they think will happen if they allow and free their employees to use all of their capabilities?\nTo put it another way, let me ask you a question. Do you think you’d feel like you were getting your money’s worth if you went to a gym and the only piece of equipment they let you use was a treadmill? What about everything else? How would you get a good workout, and good use of the money you paid, if you weren’t allowed to use all of the other equipment? What a waste of your time and your money, right?\nThere’s a quote that goes along with this line of thinking from Steve Jobs that says:\n“It doesn’t make sense to hire smart people and then tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.”\nSo my challenge to you\n(and to others at your company) is to take a moment to think about how your job, and/or the job of those you manage, can be changed to take advantage of your body, your mind and your heart!\nAnd don’t stop there, but take it that one step further and do something about it.  Why not re-design the job? Why not create a forum for employees presenting and brainstorming new ideas (\nread what Atlassian have done in this area\n)?\nWhatever you do, make sure you’re getting your money’s worth from your employees and letting your employees get the “full gym” experience and workout.\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "Why we can’t simply cut and paste\nDebra Corey\nOct 30, 2020\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nDec 19, 2020\nThe pandemic has forced us to look at life in so many different ways. Never has this been so clear as when I watched the UCLA women’s gymnastic team’s final practice. Instead of focusing on the fact that because of the pandemic their competition season had been abruptly cancelled, they focused on ending the season on a high, with a big dance party! Instead of trying to replicate one more competition, they did it in their own way, and on their own terms.\nI love this because it highlights the importance of not just cutting and pasting what we did before the pandemic, but to look for and find ways to do things differently, in new and often glorious ways.\nThis has been a conversation I’ve had with many HR leaders over the last 6 months, brainstorming on how you re-invent and not re-create activities such as onboarding, recognition events and even annual holiday parties. Based on this, I thought I’d share 3 things to keep in mind so that you don’t either scrap these important moments or simply cut and paste them:\n1.\nThink about your overall purpose\nStart by understanding why you have this activity or event, and use this as your compass to re-invent the new version of it.\nFor example, is the purpose of your annual recognition event to thank your award winners for their efforts, to make them feel special, to spotlight them to the rest of your organisation, or possibly all of the above?\n2.\nMap out how to achieve this\nNext brainstorm on what you can do to meet the objectives you’ve just agreed on. This is where you need to get creative and, as mentioned above, not merely try to replicate how you did it pre-pandemic.\nFor example, if the purpose of your holiday party was to thank everyone for their contributions during the year and to have fun, find ways to do this virtually.\nOne company I spoke to sent every employee a voucher for pizza, which they’d order and eat as they attended the virtual holiday party, thus making it fun and thanking them. Another company broke people into teams and had a big competition to have fun and bring people together. Get creative, but again, map it back to the purpose.\n3.\nAsk for ideas\nBefore finalising your plans, as with anything, go out to some or all of your employees to get their thoughts and ideas. As I always say, some of “my” best ideas have come from my workforce.\nFor example, going back to the gymnastic team, the idea of the big dance party came from the gymnasts and not the coaches. They thought of it, and the coaches supported them in making it happen.\nSo go out there and create new wonderful memories, and who knows, they may actually be better than those before the pandemic! And, by the way, do share them with me and the world, as we’d love to hear and see what you’ve done.\nAbout the author:\nDebra Corey is a highly experienced and award-winning HR leader, world-class speaker, three-time author, consultant, and was named one of the top 101 global employee engagement influencers.

    "content": "Why you need to get ‘off the main road’ to be a rebel\nDebra Corey\nJul 19, 2019\n4 min read\nUpdated:\nDec 19, 2020\nToday my husband, my son, and I were rebels as we cycled our way across Mallorca. We decided that after two days of following instructions received from the tour operator to cycle on the larger main roads, we had had enough – enough of holding our breath as the fast cars passed closely by us, enough of the weeds hitting us as we tried to stay as far away from the cars as possible, and enough of not being able to appreciate the scenery of this lovely country!\nSo we decided to be rebels – we ditched the instructions, we got off of the main roads, and we took our chances on the smaller roads and pathways. And what happened? We had a glorious day working together to find our way along the smaller roads, and taking in the absolutely stunning scenery.\nThis reminded me once again why we need to adopt a rebel approach in our personal lives and also in the workplace. As we write about in our book Build it: The Rebel Playbook, and as I speak about at events around the world, we all need to be rebels by challenging the status quo, ditching traditional ways of work, and treating our employees in a way that will truly move the engagement needle in the right direction.\nAnd to help you move in this direction, here are three lessons from our cycle ride about what it’s like to be a rebel, and the difference it can make.\n1. It may take longer.\nOne of the excuses I hear over and over again from those who are resistant to change, and the concept of being a rebel, is time. They say that trying something different will frankly just take too much time. And do you know what? They’re probably right, for often change can take more time.\nThis was certainly the case on our bikes, since going on the smaller roads added both miles and time. However, had we continued on the larger main roads I am confident that we would have all hated the journey, especially my teenage son who was on his first cycling holiday. In fact, I’m sure he would never have agreed to come with us on another cycling holiday as he so hated cycling on the busy main roads.\nThe same is true with your employees, as they’ll disengage with your traditional ways of treating them if you don’t change them. So yes it may take more time in the short-term, but it’s well worth it in the long-term for your company and for your employees, with both reaping the benefits.\n2. There will be bumps along the way.\nThe good thing about cycling on the main road was that it was well paved, so a smooth surface to ride on. However, for many of the side roads they weren’t well paved, and in fact, some were quite bumpy. For these we had to concentrate to stay upright, avoiding the large rocks that could have easily made us fall over. But, believe it or not, we actually loved the challenge, and none of us fell even once!\nThis concept of bumps is true when it comes to being a rebel in the workplace, for you’ll most certainly have bumps along the way. An example is when I was putting in place an online discount platform at a previous company as a new benefit. My Managing Director at the last minute challenged me, saying that no one would use the benefit since according to him “no one buys things on the internet”. Rubbish, we all shop on the internet, so to prove this to him I brought together a group of 50 employees and had them explain to him how they’d use this new benefit, which I’d like to point out, they loved and used all the time!\n3. There will be distractions.\nAnd finally, throughout our cycle journey, our map app would call out instructions. This was great when we were following the route, but when we decided to go out on our own, her voice quite frankly became a distraction to us. We decided to ignore her and the distractions, keeping true to our decision to get off the road.\nThe same is true in the workplace, for there will be distractions that will try to get you back ‘on the road’, back to your traditional programs, practices and ways of work. But as I say when I talk about being a rebel, you need to remember why you’re doing it, why you’re being a rebel, and what change you’re trying to make and stay true to your decision and your rebellious actions. Avoid the distractions, keep your eyes on the ‘road’, and you’ll get there at the end!\nIn ending, let me quote my husband who said that “by getting off the road we were able to get back to the reasons we went on the cycle trip in the first place.”\nSo get off the road, be a rebel, and do what you need to do for your company and for your people and . . . enjoy the ‘ride’!\nEmployee Engagement",

Trust us, we had the same reaction when we first stumbled upon the term while researching our book. But the deeper we dug, the more unsettling and eye-opening it became. It unearthed memories we couldn’t ignore. Some were uplifting, moments of true inspiration. Others? Let’s just say they serve as cautionary tales - the kind that linger like whispers in the dark.\nThe two sides of your leadership shadow\nWhen reflecting on your leadership shadow, it’s crucial to consider it in two ways, both equally important. By doing this, can you be more intentional about the shadow you cast in both directions.\nThe Shadow You Cast on Your Team\nYour actions, values, behaviors and even what you prioritize and reward shape the culture, performance, and attitudes of your people - whether you realize it or not. It’s like when your child says or does something that makes you stop and think, Wait… do I really do that? And then reality hits - you do, and they’ve simply learned by watching you.\nThe Shadow You Leave on Future Leaders\nWhether your people lead now or later, they’ll carry parts of your leadership style with them. Will they adopt your best qualities? Or will they work extra hard not to lead like you?\nWhen we interviewed people for our book, we heard this time and time again - many said they went out of their way not to duplicate the bad boss behaviors they’d experienced. Think about it - your leadership choices today shape the leaders of tomorrow.\n“A leader’s impact is like a shadow - always there, whether they realize it or not.”\nDoes Your Leadership Shadow Really Matter?\nOK, I get it, I have a shadow. But you may be wondering - is my shadow actually that big of a deal? Can it really impact my people and company that much? We could throw a bunch of stats at you to prove that, yes, it absolutely does - but where’s the fun in that? Instead, let’s dive into some real-life stories of leaders who left shadows worth following… and those whose shadows had their teams running for the exit.\nWell-Known Bosses Who Cast a Bad Shadow\nThese leaders are often remembered for toxic cultures, poor decision-making, or management styles that negatively impacted employees and business outcomes.\nElon Musk (Tesla, Twitter/X, SpaceX) The Shadow:\nMusk is a visionary but has also been accused of creating a high-pressure, fear-driven environment. Reports suggest he pushes employees to extremes, firing those who don't meet his expectations instantly, leading to stress, burnout, and instability.\nThe Impact:\nMass resignations, lawsuits from ex-employees, and reports of toxic workplace culture, especially at Twitter after mass layoffs.\nElizabeth Holmes (Theranos)The Shadow:\nHolmes sold a dream of revolutionary healthcare technology that didn’t exist, leading employees to work under deception, fear, and extreme pressure.\nThe Impact:\nThe downfall of Theranos resulted in lawsuits, criminal charges, and a massive loss of trust in leadership and Silicon Valley startups.\nHarvey Weinstein (Former Hollywood Producer)The Shadow:\nWeinstein’s leadership was built on fear, intimidation, and abuse, using his power to manipulate employees and actors.\nThe Impact:\nHis exposure sparked the\n#MeToo\nmovement, leading to legal consequences, and a massive industry reckoning on workplace abuse.\n“A bad boss is like a shadow at noon - short, ineffective, and disappears when things get tough.”\nWell-Known Bosses Who Cast a Good Shadow\nThese leaders are known for fostering trust, innovation, and engagement among their teams.\nJacinda Ardern (Former PM of New Zealand)The Shadow:\nKnown for her empathetic and decisive leadership, she prioritized kindness, communication, and well-being while leading the country through crises.\nThe Impact:\nShe gained immense trust and loyalty from both her team and the public, proving that leadership doesn’t have to be cutthroat to be effective.\nTony Hsieh (Former CEO, Zappos)The Shadow:\nHsieh revolutionized company culture by prioritizing employee happiness, customer service, and a unique, fun work environment.\nThe Impact:\nZappos became a gold standard for workplace culture, proving that happy employees drive business success.\nWarren Buffett (CEO, Berkshire Hathaway)The Shadow:\nBuffett leads with humility, long-term thinking, and trust in his employees, avoiding the flashy, egotistical CEO persona.\nThe Impact:\nHis company thrives without micromanagement, and he’s widely respected for ethical business practices.\n“Good leaders step into the light. Great leaders make sure others shine, too.”\nTo end on a positive and a call to action, here are three steps to take to be aware of your shadow:\nSelf-Reflection\n: Great leaders take a step back and regularly ‘look in the mirror’ to assess how they’re behaving, acting, and influencing their people. Do you like what you see, or do you need to take some ownership and responsibility to change the image?\nFeedback Loops\n: Great leaders aren’t afraid to go to their people for their honest feedback, providing valuable insights into how their shadow is perceived. Think of it like a more powerful mirror, having a clearer view and insights. Btw, we just introduced a fantastic 360-degree feedback tool that does this, click on this link to learn more about it.\nLook Around You\n: And finally, a sure fire way to know the impact of your leadership shadow is to look around you. Since your team’s behaviors, attitudes, and work habits are often a reflection of you - are you seeing the right ones or ones that make you pause?\nIn summary, keep in mind that your impact as a leader goes beyond the present - it shapes the future of your team and their teams to come. If you (or other managers in your organization) aren’t sure how your shadow shows up or what to do about it, we’re here to help.\nJoin us in conversations on\nLinkedIn\n, attend one of our\nworkshops\n, or catch us at\nconferences and in-house talks\n.

    "content": "Four Tools to Help Your People Learn and Grow: Unlocking the Power of the Learning Wheel\nDebra Corey\nJul 24\n3 min read\nIf you think about it, learning and growth are a lot like a wheel.\nA wheel only works when all of its spokes are in place - connected, balanced, and working together. If one spoke is missing or weak, the wheel wobbles or breaks. But when each spoke is strong and aligned, the wheel moves forward smoothly, building momentum and making a lasting impact.\nThe same is true for how leaders help their people grow and learn.\nWe call this the Learning Wheel - made up of four essential spokes:\nfeedback, appreciation, development and coaching\n. Individually, each one matters and makes a real difference. But together, they create a dynamic force that fuels growth, deepens trust, drives engagement, and leaves a lasting impact across teams and organisations.\nIn this blog, we’re focusing on these four powerful leadership tools (or what we call building blocks) - why they matter, and how to use them both individually and collectively.\nBecause great leadership isn’t about picking a single tool and sticking with it. It’s about knowing which tool to use, when to use it, and how to adapt it.\nThe 4 Spokes of the Learning Wheel\nEach spoke of this wheel plays a critical and distinct role. Think of them as complementary tools - each bringing something unique to how we lead, support, and develop others. Let’s explore each one:\nFeedback holds up a mirror 🪞\nIt helps people see what’s working (and what’s not). It provides clarity and direction, helping them correct their course. Without it, people are left guessing - which undermines both performance and confidence.\nAppreciation shines a light 🔦\nIt helps people feel valued and motivated, shining a light on their actions, behaviours, and contributions. It reinforces positive behaviours and builds emotional commitment to the team and organisation. Without appreciation, people can feel invisible - even when doing great work.\nDevelopment builds the foundation 🧱\nIt provides structured learning through courses, books, and other formal opportunities that expand knowledge and deepen skills. Without ongoing development, employees can stagnate, falling behind in fast-changing environments.\nCoaching opens a window 🪟\nIt creates space for people to reflect, problem-solve, and build ownership of their growth. Coaching strengthens critical thinking and long-term capability - something feedback alone can’t do.\nKnowing when to use each\nOne size won’t fit all. People's needs vary not only by situation but by personality, confidence, and style. As a leader, it’s important to know what your employee needs - right now, in the moment, in the situation.\nFor example, in one of our recent workshop sessions, a leader shared this insight:\n\"I realised I’d been giving a team member lots of feedback because I thought it would help. But what they actually needed was coaching - they needed space to build their own confidence. The more I ‘told’ them, the more hesitant they became. Switching to coaching helped them step up and grow.\"\nHere are four scenarios to illustrate this point:\nScenario 1: Your employee is unclear about expectations or unaware of an issue.\n→ Start with feedback.\nWhy? People can’t improve what they can’t see. Clear, timely feedback helps them understand what’s expected and where they currently stand.\nScenario 2: Your employee is stuck, unsure how to move forward, or needs to build confidence.\n→ Lean into coaching.\nWhy? Sometimes people don’t need more direction - they need space to think, reflect, and take ownership of the path forward. Coaching builds confidence and capability far beyond the immediate task.\nScenario 3: Your employee is making great progress or showing effort you want to reinforce.\n→ Offer appreciation.\nWhy? People need to feel seen and valued, not just corrected. Appreciation fuels motivation and helps people understand which behaviours and contributions are valued by the team and organisation.\nScenario 4: Your employee is eager to grow or needs to build new skills for future opportunities.\n→ Provide development opportunities.\nWhy? While feedback, coaching, and appreciation drive day-to-day performance and engagement, structured learning builds deeper expertise and broadens horizons. Development sustains long-term growth and prepares employees for what’s next.\nFinal Thought\nA car can’t drive forward smoothly without well-balanced wheels, and the same is true for learning and growth. When feedback, appreciation, coaching, and development are all in play - used in the right way, at the right time - the wheel turns easily, building momentum and helping people move forward with confidence.\nThat’s the power of the Learning Wheel - keeping growth on track and employees moving forward with confidence and purpose.\nWe love helping leaders learn and grow!\nWe design and deliver practical, engaging workshops on these four key topics, as well as other leadership building blocks outlined in our model.\nIf you’d like to explore how we can support you and your leadership team, we’d love to chat.

    "content": "Why we need to put an end to disengaging HR practices, now!\nDebra Corey\nApr 3, 2019\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nDec 19, 2020\nLet me ask you a question? Why do we design our HR policies and practices in such a disengaging way? A way that either intentionally or by chance pisses our employees off? This thought sprung to mind the other day after hearing my friend tell me about what she had to endure with her company’s performance management system. And yet again, I asked myself – why?\nWhat happened was that at about 3:00 pm on a Friday afternoon my friend, let’s call her Sue, was told by her boss that she had to put her goals into the system, so her boss could  sign off on her annual performance goals by the end of the day. Fine, in most situations this would have been a challenge, but not insurmountable. But since Sue had just started working for her new boss, this was difficult as they hadn’t yet had a chance to speak about her goals, let alone agree on them.\nSo what did they do? They made up bogus goals since they had no other choice since HR told them that it had to be done. These goals read more like the fine print at the bottom of a dense legal contract.  There’s no way a human could benefit from having 48 separate individual goals. Who are these goals for, anyway?\nAs an HR person, hearing this story both embarrassed and infuriated me! It embarrassed me, because I know that in my past I’m sure I’ve done the same thing to my managers and employees because a deadline is a deadline, right? But as I’ve entered into my rebel phase, where I question and challenge these traditional processes, it infuriates me that we let a silly deadline create such a senseless, wasteful and disengaging situation for our employees.\nUnfortunately, the story got even worse, for the second part of Sue’s problem was maneuvering within the performance management system to do her part of the process.\nShe found many pages of justification, explanation about how the information will be used, and even videos to persuade her to use it, but no link to the performance management system itself.  She spent hours trying to find instructions, or contact someone in HR, or even her boss, but the clock kept ticking.\nAnd when she was finally given the instructions, she encountered problem after problem as the system wasn’t able to handle the different computers that their employees would be using, making the assumption that everyone would be working off of a Windows computer.\nAs an HR person, again this both embarrasses and infuriates me. Why? Well if this had been a product that we were selling to our customers we would have tested it to make sure that there was a positive user experience. Why hadn’t the same been done by her HR team? Why hadn’t they made sure that there were no bugs, no hurdles getting in the way, and made sure that it was an easy and seamless process?\nThis process was intended to encourage, motivate and grow employees.  As delivered it was clearly just a tick-box solution which drives employees to distraction and makes them feel worthless and unappreciated, a ripe target for the recruiters calling them on a daily basis. And, as Sue said to me, “It created angst for nothing!”\nAs an HR community, if we ever want to improve engagement, which as we all know is atrociously low, then we need to start by taking a cold hard look at our practices and processes. Ask ourselves, who are they really designed for? Ask ourselves, do they show our employees that we care? If they don’t, then scrap them and start all over again!!\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "6 Steps for Building your Recognition Program\nDebra Corey\nMar 20, 2024\n6 min read\nBuilding (or rebuilding) an employee recognition program can be one of the most rewarding things we have the pleasure of doing as HR professionals. But it can also be one of the most challenging, trying to get it right for both your people and your business.\nTo help you in your quest to get it right, let me share with you at a high level the six steps I use when helping companies build their programs, and which I cover in my book (\nAppreciate it! The Playbook for Employee Recognition\n).\n1. Determine your recognition objectives\nThe first step is to set your recognition strategy by determining your objectives. You do this by answering the question “why”– why do you want and need to recognize your workforce? This will give you the target to aim for as you develop your individual recognition plans. Here are four things to consider as you determine your recognition objectives:\nYour company’s mission, values and culture -\nThe starting point is to align your recognition strategy with your company’s mission, values and culture. This will help you achieve your overall vision and goals (your mission), the actions and behaviors you desire (your values), and reflect who you are as a company (your culture). Do this and all the “pieces” fit together in a cohesive picture and direction. If you don’t, there will be confusion and a lack of focus.\nYour business and people objectives -\nNext, you want to align your recognition strategy with your business and people objectives. For example, do you have objectives based around developing new products to focus your workforce on innovation? Do you have people objectives around developing stronger teams to focus your workforce on collaboration? Consider these when developing your recognition strategy so that it reinforces and drives employees to meet these objectives.\nYour business and people challenges-\nNext, it’s important to align your recognition strategy with any business and people challenges that you may have. For example, is engagement, productivity, and/or retention a problem that could be positively impacted by your recognition plan? Consider these as you develop your strategy and individual programs so that they become a strength and not a weakness.\nYour reward strategy -\nAnd finally, it’s important to align your recognition strategy with your overall reward strategy. Since recognition is just one element of your rewards, along with pay, benefits, incentives, etc., it’s critical that they all work together, completing the total rewards picture and objectives.\n2. Set your recognition principles\nNow that you’ve answered the critical “why” question, you have one more thing to do before moving on to build your recognition program, and that is to create your recognition principles. These are what help you define your program, what it stands for, what makes it unique and what it says to your employees and the external marketplace. Finding the right principles will help you create recognition plans which truly drive and support your “why,” aligning with your company’s mission, values and culture.\nYou may be wondering, what is the difference between your recognition objectives and principles? Your objectives are high-level, and your principles are the next level. Your principles need to guide the design of your recognition program so that your recognition objectives are met. They are both important, and need to be determined and set up front.\n3. Determine the number of levels\nIt’s now time to start building your recognition program, getting  into the nitty-gritty details by answering the important questions of “what,” “who” and “how.” But before you do this, you need to build the framework of your program using the recognition pyramid model I cover in my book, determining the number of levels that it will have. Think of it as a blueprint for your program – the clearer the levels are in your pyramid, the more successful it will be in helping you achieve your objectives.\nHere are high level definitions for the four levels of the recognition pyramid:\nThe “everyday” level\n– The bottom level of the pyramid, the widest part, is “everyday” recognition, and is typically given by anyone at any time for day-to-day accomplishments and achievements. For this reason, it touches the most employees as it happens the most frequently. It recognizes moments that, although important, are of\nlow impact\n, meaning they impact a small number of people and/or customers with minimal impact to them and with little extra work and effort required.\nThe “above and beyond” level\n– Here is where the pyramid starts getting a bit narrower, symbolizing how fewer employees would typically receive this type of recognition as it’s harder to reach this level of achievement. It recognizes moments that are of\nhigher impact\n, meaning where employees or teams have excelled, going above and beyond to get the job done. Think of it as a ladder, with employees needing to work that much harder to get to the next rung of the ladder, which in this case is your recognition plan.\nThe “best of the best” level\n– The top level of the pyramid symbolizes those who went above and beyond the most – often outside of their typical job role – symbolizing performing at the highest level within your organization. It recognizes moments that are of the\nhighest impact\n, having a larger or more long-term impact on a group or the business, requiring more work and effort to accomplish this. Again, think of it as a ladder, but this time think of the bell at the top that you ring when you get to the very top.\nYears of service level\n– This level of the pyramid as explained earlier sits outside of the primary levels of the pyramid, and is used to recognize employees for hitting certain key tenure milestones.\nNow before you ask me how many levels there should be in your pyramid, let me say that there is no perfect or magic number, the key here is to come up with the number of levels that will ultimately help you meet your recognition objectives. If it takes one level to do this, great! And if it’s four, that’s fine as well.\n4. Design your recognition plans\nOnce you’ve decided on your recognition levels, the next step is to design your individual recognition plans. To do this, you’ll need to determine the following for each of your recognition levels:\nDetermine the “what”\n- Start by answering the question “what,” which will help drive your reward and recognition strategy, as well as send a strong message to your employees about what is appreciated at your company, and how their contributions are valued. There are two parts to this question, which I describe as the “in” and the “out.” The “in” represents what goes into recognition, so what needs to happen to be recognized. The “out” represents what goes out of recognition, so what the person recognized will receive when they are recognized.\nDecide the “who”\n- The next question to answer is the “who,” which is when you decide who will be able to give, receive and approve recognition and recognition awards. Keep in mind that the answers to the questions may differ from recognition plan to recognition plan, which is absolutely fine as the intent and goal of the plans will differ.\nDecide the “when”\n- The final decision you’ll have to make is the “when,” which has to do with when employees will be recognized under each of your recognition plans. As with the “who,” the “when” may differ from recognition plan to recognition plan, which again is absolutely fine.\n5 – Decide how your recognition plans will work\nThe next question to answer is the “how” – how will you ensure that your recognition program and individual recognition plans deliver on your objectives once they’re in place? I want to stress that this is just as important as designing the “right” recognition program, for I’ve seen fantastic ones fail if this isn’t done well. During this step, you’ll need to answer the following four questions:\nManage\n– how will you manage and operationalize your recognition plan?\nCommunicate\n– how will you communicate your recognition plans to ensure your employees engage with them?\nTrain\n– how will you train your workforce to ensure they understand and engage with recognition?\nMeasure\n– how will you measure your recognition programs to understand if/how they are meeting your objectives?\n6 – Design your recognition branding\nThe final decisions you’ll need to make relate to the branding of your recognition program, which includes the names and designs. Although this isn’t absolutely necessary, I’ve found it to be extremely helpful in making that all-important first impression with your employees, making them decide in an instant whether they’ll engage with your recognition program or not. I actually love working on this step, as it’s where you give your hard work a meaningful and often fun personality. During this step, you’ll need to do the following:\nI hope you find these six steps helpful in building or rebuilding your recognition program and plans. Should you require further details on how to get this right, you can find them in my book (\nAppreciate it! The Playbook for Employee Recognition\n), or feel free to\ncontact me directly\n.

    "content": "Two ways to turn managers from recognition doubters to advocates\nDebra Corey\nFeb 8, 2023\n5 min read\nNo matter how great HR is at designing and delivering recognition programs,\nthey'll never work without the support and ownership of your managers.\nFor although your program is your “secret sauce,” your managers are the ones using it (or not using it) to deliver that great “taste.”\nWhat do you do when your managers don’t believe and buy into the concept of recognition? What do you do when they’re preventing you from achieving that ‘\nappreciation feeling\n,’ one where your people feel valued and appreciated for the contributions and differences they make?\nLet me first say that you are not alone, that I’ve encountered this resistance time and time again from managers, having been in your shoes in the quest to turn doubters to advocates. To help you with this, let me share with you two ways to overcome this challenge and create a group of managers who understand, embrace and are advocates of recognition and appreciation.\n# 1 - Help managers understand the POWERS of recognition\nThe first thing to do is to help your managers see the power of recognition, so why it’s important to them as a manager, to their people and to the company as a whole.\nI call these “superpowers” as they can turn employees into superheroes, ones that do extraordinary things to help you, their colleagues and their companies innovate more, succeed more, and overcome obstacles and challenges.\nHere are seven of these recognition and appreciation superpowers 🦸:\n1. Higher engagement\nLet’s start with employee engagement, something that most companies focus on and measure as they’ve come to see the power it can have on their business. Recognition has been proven to be a key driver of employee engagement, with a study by Deloitte finding that\nemployee engagement was 14% higher in organisations where they practise employee recognition\nthan in those without recognition. This should come as no surprise, for a key driver for engagement is to feel valued, which is a direct result of recognition.\n2. Greater happiness\nEmployee happiness, like employee engagement, can also have a positive impact on a business. In Shawn Achor’s book The Happiness Advantage, he talks about how happiness leads to employees who feel more positive, are more creative, are better at solving problems, and are more effective collaborators, all of which contribute to a more successful company.\nAnd what is that connection to recognition? Well, according to a study that ranked the 26 factors of happiness on the job, they found that “\nthe most important single job element for all people is appreciation for their work\n,” which, as we know, occurs through recognition.\n3. Less burned out\nWith burnout on the rise due to symptoms of the more fast-paced, complex and demanding modern workplace, it’s something that we all need to take seriously. Recognition can contribute to preventing and/or reducing burnout as it addresses some of the factors that can lead to it such as feelings of unfair treatment at work, unclear communication from managers and lack of manager support.\nSupporting this, one study found that when recognition hits the mark,\n73% of employees are less likely to always or very often feel burned out.\n4. Better sense of awareness\nThis next superpower moves from how the employee feels as a result of being recognized, to what they receive: An increased sense of awareness. This happens through feedback, which is formally and informally given each and every time an employee is recognized. It lets them know which of their efforts are most appreciated and valued, giving them a sense of achievement and an awareness of which actions and behaviours they should continue to lead to greater success.\n“Feedback through recognition quiets the negatives that take up so much of our employees' thoughts and time, helping them know that they're on the right track, that what they do matters and is truly making a difference.”\n5. More productive\nIt's not just employees who benefit from recognition, the company does as well. One way is through an increase in productivity, since having employees who are engaged, happy, less burned out and more aware naturally leads to a more productive work environment.\nA study shows that\n79% of employees would work harder if they felt their efforts were being recognized\n, and research done by Shawn Achor shows that\nemployee productivity can increase by 30% when employees receive just one piece of praise a day\n.\n6. Stronger business results\nNext, is that these other powers will ultimately help your company be more successful and achieve higher business results.\nAccording to a study, companies that excel at employee recognition on average are 12 times more likely to generate strong business results than their peers. And to make it even more compelling, according to another report, if organisations would double the number of employees who receive recognition for their work on a weekly basis, they would experience a 24% improvement in quality and a 10% reduction in shrinkage, both which contribute to achieving company goals.\n7. Better employee retention\nAnd finally, recognition can have an impact on employee turnover, with employees staying longer because they feel valued and appreciated through recognition. We often believe that pay is the number one reason people leave a company, but in fact, a study found that 79% of employees who quit their job cited a lack of recognition as the key driver.\nAnd for those who have not left their company, a study found that employees who do not feel adequately recognized are twice as likely to say they'll quit in the next year.\n#2\nHelp managers understand the IMPACT of recognition from a manager\nIt’s also important to let managers understand that recognition from them as a manager can have additional powers and impacts, some different and some multipliers of the previous powers. Here are the five that I share in my book titled\nSee it. Say it. Appreciate it!\n:\n1. Stronger business results\nA study found that when leaders and managers are actively involved in employee recognition, companies are 9 times more likely to have strong business results.\n2. Improved relationship with managers\n58% of employees report that their relationship with their manager would improve\nif they were given more recognition.\n3. Improved morale\n70% of employees said that their motivation and morale would improve if their managers would simply thank them more.\n4. Improved trust\nEmployees who were recognized were 34% more likely to trust senior leaders and 33% more likely to trust managers, compared to those who had never been recognized.\n5. More likely to recognize others\nWhen a manager recognizes their people, they in turn are 2.5 times more likely to recognize others.\nI encourage you to share this information and data with your managers, using it to help them make the move from recognition doubters to adopters. And together you can leverage the power and impact that appreciation through recognition can have.\nIf you'd like to read more about recognition and appreciation, feel free to check out my books -\nAppreciate it!

They are designed to keep our companies and our people on track and out of danger. And in these challenging times, when the ‘waters’ are challenging and volatile, our values can be the beacon of light showing an organization and it's people the path to safety.\nIn recent times, companies from around the world have shown the true power of their values, using them time and again in new, innovative ways. Regardless of country, industry or demographics, there have been fantastic examples of what I call ‘values warriors’ emerging, armed with their values, and ready to be a part of the solution as they protect, support and care for their communities and for their people.\nI’ve had the pleasure of interviewing some of these values warriors over the last six months, collecting their wonderful stories to share in a new chapter of my book (and free eBook) on company values. Here are three examples of value warriors sharing some of the many ways that they lived their values with the community and with their people.\nAtos\nA global leader in digital transformation, Atos has used its seven values time and time again to help the global fight against COVID-19 and to support its people.\nFor instance, the organization helped local authorities contain the spread of the virus by designing EpiSYS, an Epidemic Management System (EMS) that gives health professionals a precise overview of an epidemiological situation. In order to achieve this, it stores and manages all patient data and virus-related data, including tracking and tracing patient incident reports, in real-time.\nAnother way Atos has displayed its values was by supporting employees through activities such as a two-week virtual kids summer camp, open to all employees’ children to support working parents and carers. It was run as a community, with parents having to conduct a one-hour session based on any talent or skill they selected.\nSessions ranged from French and sign language lessons, to karate, to how to make Play-Doh. They even brought in business-related topics such as how to code and information on climate change and diversity.\nPlymouth Community Homes (PCH)\nThe largest social housing landlord in Plymouth, South-West England, PCH used its four company values to help and support both its residents and employees during lockdown.\nOne way it achieved this was by providing its residents with online courses through its ‘Learn for Free’ program, and holding chat groups to help them stay connected and ease social isolation.\nAnother way was by leveraging its employee communications platform which is named ‘Jannet’, since in Plymouth people are known as ‘Janners.’ They used it to provide daily updates on COVID-19, operational information on what was critical to know in order to get work done, as well as a section where employees could post stories and photos to share their personal experiences.\nAn example of this came from a surprising source – an employee by the name of Mark, a builder, who decided that every day he would share a video that included a daily thought. He named it ‘Thoughts from Mark’s mound’, as he filmed them on a grass bank just outside PCH’s stores building where he picked up his stock each morning.\nTeleperformance (TP)\nA global leader in customer experience management, TP used its five values as well as its main goal of ‘happiness from inside out’ to support its community and employees throughout the pandemic.\nOne example of this was its ‘Keep Smiling’ campaign, which donned the tagline: ‘Working together to keep the nation smiling, helping care homes spread the joy.’ Cards were designed by TP employees and family members that displayed hand-drawn images and upbeat messages such as ‘Be strong, things will get better’, ‘Storms don’t last forever’, and ‘Keep smiling.’ Uplifting messages were written on cards and sent to residents in care homes as well as key workers, delivering them along with treats so that they didn’t feel forgotten and, of course, kept smiling.\nThey also did this by using employee competitions to drive connections throughout the pandemic, putting their creativity on display. These ranged from an Easter craft competition for kids, to a poetry competition for employees and family members, to a TelePETformance competition where photos were submitted showcasing the talents or funny habits of their pets. You name it, and they had a competition for it, all serving as a means to connect, interact, and celebrate together.\nI hope you’ve found these stories inspiring, and that they help you as you continue to live your values throughout the pandemic and beyond.\nThis blog was originally posted on\nHRD Connect\n.\nCompany Values",

    "content": "3 Ways to Communicate with Empathy\nDebra Corey\nMay 15, 2024\n4 min read\nUpdated:\nMar 2\nCommunicating to your employees is easy, right? All you have to do is share words and concepts, how hard can it be?\nWell according to one\nsurvey,\nalmost seven out of ten managers (69%) admitted feeling uncomfortable communicating with their employees\n, being uncomfortable with “becoming vulnerable, recognizing achievements, delivering the ‘company line,’ giving clear directions, crediting others with having good ideas, speaking face to face, and having difficult feedback conversations in general.”\nIt doesn’t surprise me that so many bosses find communication daunting. Unlike with basketball when the hoop is always the same, always 10 feet above the floor, our employees are far from being the same.\nThat’s because people take in and translate information in different ways when they receive communications. That constant pressure of “scoring” with what you’re trying to communicate leads to worrying, and often, even an “air ball.” Similarly, if the employee(s) you are speaking to are under a lot of pressure, they might be thinking about the work they are supposed to be doing rather than listening to your communication; much like a basketball player not being in the right place to receive a pass.\nIn our book (\nBad Bosses Ruin Lives: The Building Blocks for Being a Great Boss\n) we share many tips on how to improve your communication skills. The area we’d like to focus on in this blog relates to communicating with empathy, which has\nto do with\nthe way\nyou communicate, e.g. the tone, words, and approach that you use. This is critical to keep in mind, for even if you communicate in the most effective way, without empathy or bringing compassion to the situation, then it will fall flat and not meet your objectives.\nEmpathetic communication is delivering information in a way that understands and addresses the feelings and needs of the recipient.\nIf done well, it’s a win-win, with you being able to effectively “throw” the message to the recipient, and them being able to “catch” it as they’re in the right space and frame of mind to do so.\nTo help you with this, let’s look at how to use empathy in three ways - the what, when, and where you communicate information:\n1) Consider the \"what\"\nUsing empathy in sharing information is impacted by both\nwhat information you share\nand\nwhat words you use\n. Here’s an example of when I got it wrong when it came to the first part.\nI had an employee who was on maternity leave, something I had never been on myself at this point in time. Because of this, I couldn’t put myself in her shoes and didn’t do what I now understand to be important, which was to ask her what kind of information she wanted from me during this period of time. The result was that I hoarded information, not sharing it with her because I thought she wouldn’t want it, thinking that she’d be too busy taking care of her newborn to read any of it. Wrong! When she came back from her leave, she was quite angry with me for doing this, saying that the information would have helped her feel more connected to the business and her colleagues, and would have made her transition back to work much easier. Ouch, did I get this wrong or what?\n2) Consider the \"when\"\nBelieve it or not, the\ntiming\nof when you share information can have an impact on how it makes your people feel, and thus needs to be addressed in an empathetic way. Here’s an example from our friend Pat, with a boss who got it completely wrong.\nThe situation was that on Pat’s last working day before they had a week off for the holiday season, Pat’s boss said that they needed to talk to them immediately. They jumped on a call, where Pat was told that the team was going to be reorganized and that Pat would find out more details when they came back from the holiday break. As you can imagine, Pat panicked, wondering how this would impact them and their team, and spent the entire week worrying about it instead of enjoying the holiday with their family and friends. In this situation, my challenge to Pat’s boss would have been, did you really need to do it then? What would have happened if you had waited another week?\n3) Consider the \"where\"\nAnother thing you may not have considered is where you share and put the information. Do you share it in an email, on a team call, or even a text? Make sure that the information is available in a form the employees can refer back to to refresh their memory, and that they all know where it is. There are so many ways to do it, so think about what will work best for your people and for the specific communication.\nYou\nmay also want to signpost your people to find out more information on their own, especially if it’s ongoing or far into the future. What kind of FAQ or other information do your employees need to save you time from answering questions and so they feel the most informed?\nCommunication\nLeadership",

    "content": "8 places to look for recognition moments\nDebra Corey\nNov 23, 2022\n4 min read\nOne of the biggest reasons that recognition (and recognition programs) fail is that important recognition moments are missed.\nGreat things are happening all around us that deserve to be recognized, but we’re missing them because we don’t understand that they should be recognized, and we’re not looking in the right places\n.\nThis means that we have employees who aren’t being recognized and don’t feel appreciated (65% of employees said they haven’t been recognized in the last year). And because of this, they aren’t motivated, aren’t performing and are taking action (75% of employees who quit their jobs cited lack of appreciation as the key driver).\nFor this reason, the first part of the mantra that I share in my new book titled\nSee it. Say it. Appreciate it!\nis to ‘see it,’ meaning to look for recognition moments everywhere and anywhere. In training classes with managers I often say that we all need to put our recognition “glasses” on, thus looking for and seeking out opportunities to recognize our people. This is absolutely critical, for if we don’t first see the moments, then they will be missed, and the appreciation will never happen.\nThe absolute starting point of appreciation is to see it, to notice all of those moments that deserve to be recognized, to be intentional and take that first step.\nAnother way to think of it is to move from a one-dimensional to a multi-dimensional approach to recognition and appreciation. In a one-dimensional approach, we’re only looking for or thinking of recognition in one way. For example, we’re only looking for those superstars, those winners of what I call the ‘best of the best’ recognition programs. Or we’re only recognizing one member of a team that delivered a key project, and not others that helped to make it happen. Or finally, we’re focusing on those big ‘wins,’ ignoring all of those small and important wins and contributions that happen along the way.\n“It’s worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change.” Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II\nTo bring this to life, here are eight examples of possible recognition moments that I share in my book to get managers on their way:\nHighlighting quality work\n– When your employees stand out by putting time and effort into delivering quality work, it’s cause for recognition. This shows them that you appreciate them doing what it takes to get things done.\nSuggesting new ideas\n– As you know, innovation is key to helping you and your company succeed, pushing the boundaries on what you do and how you get things done. Recognizing your people when they take the initiative to present a new idea can be a great way to thank them for this contribution, encouraging them and others to take this leap going forward.\nLearning a new skill\n– Key to the success of your people and your business is development, with these new skills key to helping them improve and be their best. To encourage this, it’s important to recognize the achievement of these new skills, letting your people know that you value and appreciate them taking the time and putting the effort into this accomplishment.\nAchieving key milestones\n– It’s important to recognize the achievement of key milestones, or what I like to call those “small wins.” Doing so will help your employees feel valued for their contributions, and also energize them, giving them the boost and confidence they need to keep going to achieve their overall objectives.\nAchieving outstanding results\n– When your employees achieve outstanding results by delivering a major assignment or project, it’s a perfect reason to recognize them. Use recognition as a cause for celebration, showing them the difference their contributions made in the final results.\nSupporting a colleague or customer\n– When one of your employees goes out of their way to support a colleague or customer, this is another opportunity to recognize them. By doing this, it shows them and others that providing this level of service is valued and important to you and to your company.\nShowing teamwork and cooperation\n– Look for opportunities to recognize not just individuals, but teams. When you see them working together and collaborating to deliver great work, use recognition as a way to celebrate and encourage new ways to break down silos within your business and get everyone working toward the same goals.\nLiving your company values\n– And finally, just as important as the “what,” so what your employees have accomplished, is the “how,” or what many companies define as their company values or beliefs. These are the actions and behaviors that you have identified as the ones that you believe are essential in achieving your company’s mission and purpose, and creating and maintaining the culture that is right for your business and people. And for this reason, recognizing employees for living your company values will send the message to them that they are important, encouraging them to live them over and over again.\nAs I often say to managers, at first it may be difficult to see and find these recognition moments as you haven’t been looking for them in the past, but trust me, it will get easier, and soon they’ll “jump off the page” as they become so obvious and apparent.\nI hope you’ve found this helpful, and please feel free to share this concept and these examples with your managers to help them move to a more multi-dimensional approach to recognition. By doing this it will open the door to capturing more recognition moments, and delivering the feeling of appreciation to a wider group of well-deserving employees.\nRecognition",

    "content": "Inspiring Your People Through Volcanoes\nDebra Corey\nNov 1, 2024\n4 min read\nUpdated:\nApr 12\nInspiration is the invisible fuel that motivates and powers your people. It's the catalyst that transforms mundane tasks into meaningful endeavors, elevating the collective spirit and driving everyone toward a common goal. When a team is inspired, the atmosphere is electric – ideas flow freely, collaboration is effortless, and challenges are met with enthusiasm rather than dread.\nInspiration can be that magic ingredient that can propel work from mediocrity to excellence, and it's often the distinguishing factor between teams and companies that merely function and those that truly thrive and succeed.\nBut how can you inspire your people during challenging times? Great question, and one we'll be answering in this blog, sharing the story of how bosses at the Blue Lagoon Iceland inspired their people when dealing with the recent volcanoes. They didn’t just use one strategy—they used a combination of building blocks from our Great Boss Building Block model, and the result wasn’t just additive; it multiplied their effectiveness.\nAlthough all bosses won’t have to inspire in these situations, we can all agree that challenges and disasters come in different shapes and sizes, so it’s always best to be armed with as many inspirational tools as possible.\nSo let’s answer a few questions regarding Inspiration . . . . .\nWhy is inspiration important?\nHaving an inspired workforce is absolutely critical to your business for a variety of reasons.\nFirst, it can lead to higher levels of engagement and performance, as your people are more likely to be emotionally invested in their work and the company's success.\nNext, it can be a driving force behind innovation and unlocking creativity, as inspired people are more likely to think outside the box and challenge the status quo.\nFinally, inspiration can foster a positive work environment, as inspired teams are generally happier, more motivated, cohesive, and collaborative.\nAdd this all together, and your people will be more satisfied with their jobs, while your business will have lower turnover and be more successful.\nWhat’s a boss’s role?\nWhen we defined Inspiration previously, we explained it as an invisible fuel. For this reason, in our workshops, we encourage attendees to think of themselves as Inspiration Engineers or Mechanics. Picture yourself pumping inspiration fuel to and through your people to motivate and power them to perform and succeed. And to remind yourself how important your role is, picture one of your people in a situation where their car’s fuel gauge was on empty. Without you ‘filling them up’ with inspiration, they face a whole wrath of negative consequences.\nHow can bosses inspire their people?\nThere’s no one way to inspire your people as a boss, no magic bullet. Depending on the situation and person, there are a variety of approaches, tools, etc., that will inspire your people and add that fuel they need. In our book, we cover ones such as being a purpose-led boss, being clear on expectations, and communicating the ‘why’. But based on our workshops at the Blue Lagoon Iceland, we’d like to share a few more ways and tips for inspiring your people:\nBring out the Trust building block\n- We heard time and time again from the Blue Lagoon bosses how critical trust was as a means to inspire their people, as a way to encourage them to return to the resort following the various volcanic eruptions. They explained that without this, their team's fears would have prevented them from leaving the safety and comfort of their homes and taking that step onto the resort. They did this by not only relying on the trust their people had with their bosses and the company, but also creating a new level of trust by bringing onboard scientists and specialists. This showed their people that they were taking the situation seriously and were committed to supporting them in the best way possible.  By having experts guide them in their decisions, it strengthened their people's trust by knowing that the company was doing the right thing for the business, for them, and for their customers. You can’t inspire your people if they don’t trust you enough to take that first step. Inspiration begins with trust.\nBring out the Compassion building block\n- Another building block we heard mentioned when we workshopped Inspiration was compassion. Bosses shared example after example of how they had acted compassionately towards their people to inspire them to work through these challenging times. One of my favorite examples was how, after a volcano-related closure, one of the bosses told us she came in before her team to take pictures of the resort. She shared them, letting her people know and see that it was safe to come to work and showing compassion by addressing any fears they may have had up front. I love this as it shows how this boss showed empathy by understanding her people’s fears and then acted compassionately by easing them through her actions.\nAn Inspirational boss shows up for their people through regular and meaningful acts of compassion.\nBring out the Communication building block\n- Finally, communication was another building block that bosses at the Blue Lagoon mentioned as critical in helping them inspire their people. They shared examples of their proactive and transparent approach to communication, using this as a way to fill the fuel tank of inspiration. From the business having weekly information meetings to bosses individually sharing with their people, they didn’t hide from sharing information. They used it as a powerful tool to inspire their people, allowing them to continue delivering unforgettable memories for their guests.\nLet us end by thanking our friends at the Blue Lagoon for enlightening us on how they’ve used and adapted the Inspiration building block to lead their business and people through volcanoes and earthquakes. They should all be very proud of themselves, being role models to other companies who deal with what life throws their way. You inspire your people, your guests, and most certainly me!\nPlease contact us if you want to learn more about how we can help leaders at your company.\nLeadership",

    "content": "The $8.8 Trillion Disengagement Problem - and 2 Things to Do About It\nDebra Corey\n3 days ago\n3 min read\nWhen my book on employee engagement, Build It: The Rebel Playbook for Employee Engagement, was released in 2018, Gallup reported that global engagement was sitting at a not-so-stellar 18%.\nFast forward to Gallup’s most recent 2024 report, and it’s up slightly to 21%. Progress? Sort of. But here’s the twist: that number is actually down from the year before, the first decline in a decade. The slow climb has stalled. And the big question is: what’s going wrong?\nGallup isn’t shy about pointing fingers. This time, they’re aiming squarely at managers, whose own engagement has dropped from 30% to 27% globally. They say that dip is dragging teams down with it. Seems a little harsh, doesn’t it?\nBut let’s be honest: it’s no surprise. Being a manager today is tough. Expectations are sky-high. Change is relentless. And employees are more vocal about what they want, and don’t want, from their work experience.\nMany managers are feeling overwhelmed, undertrained, and under-supported. Something had to give. And it has. The cost? A staggering $8.8 trillion a year. That’s 9% of global GDP, lost to disengagement.\nSo what can you do? You can’t fix the global economy, but there are two steps to help yourself and engagement in general move in the right direction.\nStep One: Put on your engagement oxygen mask first\nLast year, I learned (the hard way) what happens when you forget to put your own oxygen mask on first. Spoiler: it ended with me being in a hospital bed for a week. Not exactly part of my leadership development plan. If you’re running on empty, you can’t show up as the leader your team needs. So be honest with yourself and:\nSet some boundaries. Yes, you’re allowed to block time for deep work, or a proper, uninterrupted lunch.\nGet curious. What’s fuelling you? What’s draining you? Awareness is absolutely critical to your engagement and wellbeing.\nRedefine success. What does growth really look like for you now and in the future? Redefine it on your own terms.\nSay no more often. Protect your “yes” for the stuff that really matters.\nThe best leaders know the secret: it starts with you. If you’re not engaged, energised, or clear on what matters-how can you expect your team to be? When you get it right with yourself first, you give your people a much better shot at thriving, too.\nStep Two: Do engagement the ‘smart’ way\nNow that you’re recharged (or at least refilling your cup), it’s time to engage your team - but let’s be smart about it. Think of it like using a smart device. You don’t manually turn every light on in your house anymore, you tap a button or let automation handle it. Less energy, more efficiency.\nThe same goes for leading your people. You don’t need to do it all or throw everything at the wall to see what sticks. You just need to know what your people need, and deliver the right support at the right time.\nThat might mean:\nReally listening to someone who’s struggling.\nOffering a little praise when it’s overdue.\nOr stepping into coach mode when someone’s stuck.\nIt’s not about constant hustle. It’s about leading with intention, so you’re working smarter, not harder.And the best part? When you get this right, engagement becomes a lot less of a grind, and a lot more of a natural flow.\nAsk yourself:\nDo I really know what’s motivating (or de-motivating) each person on my team?\nWhat’s one simple thing I could do this week to boost engagement?\nWhich of the Great Boss Building Blocks™ could I use right now to unlock more energy, connection, or clarity?\nThe bottom line?\nNo, you can’t fix global engagement single-handedly. But you can shape it-block by block, person by person, starting with yourself. So this week, reflect on:\nWhat do I really know about my team’s engagement-beyond the last engagement survey?\nWhat am I doing to protect and improve my own engagement?\nWhich building blocks will help me lead just a little bit better this week?\nLet’s start fixing the problem together!\nTags:\nDevelopment\nLeadership\nLeadership",

    "content": "3 ways we piss our employees off - Part 1\nDebra Corey\nJan 15, 2019\n4 min read\nUpdated:\nDec 19, 2020\nMy 17 year-old daughter Chloe absolutely hates hypocrites. In fact, as she tells me over and over again, “they really piss me off.”\nIs she young and naive?\nYes\n. Is she wrong?\nNo\n. Is she alone in her thinking?\nAbsolutely not!\nThen why do we so often act as hypocrites with our employees? Why do we say one thing to them, and then turn around and do something entirely different? Don’t we know the damage we’re causing by, quoting my daughter again, pissing them off?!\nThis is something I’ve been thinking about a lot lately as I’m starting to see the world of work through the eyes of my daughter, as well as being surrounded by a workforce full of millennials.\nFor this reason I’ve decided to write a two-part blog on the things that really piss our employees off. The three listed below come directly from situations I’ve had with Chloe, who at 17 is new to the job market. However, that doesn’t or shouldn’t really matter because I’m sure there are others in our companies who feel the same way.\n1. Do we call candidates back when we say we will?\nThis is where my conversation with Chloe started, with her complaining about how a recruiter promised they’d call her by the end of the day to let her know if she got the job. A week later they finally called her back to offer her the job. Did she take it? Absolutely not, there was no way she was going to work for a hypocrite!\nThe impact of this is that we lose quality employees. And why not? Their first impression of us is that we care so little about them that we can’t spare the 5 minutes it would take to call them, even if it is to say that they don’t have a decision yet?\nThe solution to this one is simple, if you tell a candidate you’re going to call them, call them! It’s not rocket science, just do it!\n2. Do we show our employees we appreciate them?\nShowing employees we appreciate them by recognizing them is an area that Chloe knows a lot about. She’s either heard me talk about what I’m doing with employees at my companies, or sharing stories I’ve heard by talking to other companies as research for my books or blogs.\nFor this reason she was even more pissed off when her boss at a previous job told her he appreciated her, and then day-after-day did little to nothing to show her he did. To make it worse, one day a customer came up to tell her that he appreciated all she had done to help, and then watched as he went to tell her manager the same thing.\nPerfect, she told me, he’ll finally tell me that he appreciates me. But he never did, so instead she came home angry, and, you got it, pissed off! And a week later, she left this job.\nThe solution to this one is to tackle the obstacles in the way that hold back recognition, helping our managers understand the power it has over employees and the business, and give them tools and coach them to deliver on this. No more excuses, it’s time that we all get out there and show our employees we appreciate them.\n3. Do we pay our employees in a human way?\nThis last one may seem a bit odd, but the reason I’m listing it is because of a recent event. What happened was that Chloe came home and told me that she had no money because she’d loaned all of hers to her boyfriend. When I asked her why, she said it was because he is paid monthly and she is paid weekly. So in her mind, she had less time not to have money than him, so it was the right thing to do.\nShe then when on to tell me how ridiculous it was that a company would pay monthly, caring so little for their employees that they put them in financially challenging situations. As I tried to explain to her why companies do this, for in fact I had in the past changed payrolls from weekly to monthly quite a few times, I became embarrassed by my past actions. For yes it saved the company money and time, but in return we were pissing our employees off but making their lives more difficult. Had we thought of this when making these important decisions?\nThe solution to this one is not as straightforward as the others, for I do know that there is a cost associated with making changes when it comes to payroll. But what I would say is that if we want our employees on our side, putting their all into their jobs, we need to be more conscious and sensitive to their needs in all of our HR practices.\nWe need to challenge ourselves to understand the true impact of what we decide to do, and if possible find solutions where we can balance the needs of the company and the employees. Our employees expect us to do it, so get out and do it!\nSo that’s the end of this first of my two-part blog. If you’d like to share anything that you think should be on the next list, please contact me. Until then, I wish you all the best in engaging your employees and not pissing them off!\nEmployee Engagement",

And by doing this, all of the positive impacts of recognition are multiplied, with more eyes, ears and hearts looking for, capturing and celebrating recognition moments.\nAt East Coast College they take this to the next level by not only having their employees involved, but their students as well. And while students play a different role, they are still integral in delivering the ‘appreciation feeling’ which is oh so important.\nHere are a few examples of how East Coast College involve employees and students throughout the various elements of their recognition program:\nRecognition Cards\nThe first level of their program are recognition cards, which anyone can give to another person at any point in time. They have a range of cards (e.g. thank you cards, ‘you are a star’ cards, congratulation cards and teamwork cards) to reflect the many ways and times that appreciation can be shown. And by not limiting these to just managers, all of the everyday recognition moments are captured and celebrated.\nStar of the Month\nThe next level is their Star of the Month program, where all staff are encouraged to vote for a member of staff who has been their star of the month. Nominations can be for any reason, but they encourage them to be linked to their company values.\nThe winner gets a spin on the ‘Winner’s Wheel,’ which was made by students in their carpentry department. Prizes include an extra day of holiday, a meal for two at their onsite restaurant, free lunch in their canteen for the week or an Amazon voucher. I love that students created the wheel (how proud must they be of it!), and also that the prizes are low cost as they’re leveraging their restaurant and canteen.\nStaff Celebration\nAnother element of their program is a staff celebration that is held every year in July, and is a chance for all staff from both of their sites to get together and celebrate how amazing they all are. They have a selection of awards that are given out on the day to individuals and teams, and like the monthly award, are voted for by their staff.  In addition to awards, the event is all about having fun together, with lots of activities such as axe throwing, yoga, cake decorating, reflexology, a photo booth, an ice cream van and much more! They again had carpentry students involved, having them create a giant Jenga game which could be played. Here's a photo of one of their Chef’s after he’d been to see a media makeup students, love the beard!\nStar Performers Award Event\nThe final level of their recognition program is an annual event to celebrate what I call the ‘Best of the Best’ level, or what they call their Stars of the Year. Each department manager puts forward a member of their team to attend the event, along with an explanation as to why they were selected.  As Lynsey Wright, Development and Wellbeing Lead explained, “It’s a great way for staff to meet other winners while enjoying a meal and completing Ann’s famous quiz.”\nStudents have a large role to play with this event. Since it’s held at their onsite restaurant, students who are completing their catering qualification cook the meal, hospitality students serve the meal, and other students provide musical entertainment on arrival. And to make sure that they feel appreciated, at the end of the evening they make a big deal out of thanking them all.\nI hope this inspires you to find your own way to get your people involved in recognition. Whether it’s your leaders, managers, employees, students, etc., remember that together you have the best chance of delivering the ‘appreciation feeling.’\nPlease\ncontact me\nif you'd like to discuss how you can create innovative and effective recognition programs at your company.\nTags:\nAppreciation\nRecognition\nRecognition rewards\nRecognition",

    "content": "Two ways to use 'why' to drive and explain change\nDebra Corey\nJul 11, 2023\n3 min read\nDuring a recent talk I was asked the question, “how in the world did you explain such a drastic change in your benefits program” after telling the story of removing one of my employee’s favorite benefit programs. Although it certainly wasn’t easy to do, the simple answer is by focusing on the word ‘why’, doing so in two very important ways.\n#1\n- Use 'why' to determine the change\nThe first way is by using ‘why’ to\ndetermine the change\nin the first place. For anyone who has ever worked with or heard me talk, you’ll know that I always always always start with strategy, and start by asking why -\nwhy are we making this change?\nThis is absolutely critical, as the change needs to be firmly centered around strategy or it’s never going to work - for your business and your people. Let me share two examples to bring this to life:\nLottery benefit\n- The first example relates to the story I was sharing in the talk, which was when we removed a favorite employee benefit. The benefit was a lottery, where ten employee names were randomly selected each month, receiving anywhere from £1,000 - £100. Sound like fun, it was!\nThe ‘why’ for the change, which was removing the benefit, was that in reviewing all benefits against the newly established reward principles, it was decided that a lottery did not align with any of them. With new principles of fairness, balance and choice to name a few, rewarding luck was not amongst them. So, goodbye to this benefit.\nRecognition award\n- The second example relates to a change made in a client’s recognition program, which began as a monthly award given to ten employees selected from those nominated. When I asked them for their ‘why,’ they explained that it was put in place as a way to encourage employees to recognize one another for the great work they were doing.\nWith the ‘why’ in mind, we changed the program from having a set number of award winners to being open-ended. Thus, if five people each month met the criteria there were five winners, if 20 people met the criteria there were 20 winners, and so on. By making this change it better aligned with their why of encouraging recognition, not having unnecessary constraints in place.\n#2\n- Use 'why' to communicate and explain the change\nThe second way is by using ‘why’ to\ncommunicate and explain the change\n. Too often we either withhold the truth or don’t share the whole story, the entire ‘why’ when we communicate change to our employees. By doing this, by not sharing the rationale, we risk them not fully understanding, buying into, and trusting the change.\n“Your employees deserve to hear the truth. And if you don’t tell them it, trust me, they’ll create their own version of the truth . .. . which is often worse than the actual truth!”\nGoing back to my example of removing the lottery benefit, this is exactly what we did. We took them on the journey of creating our reward principles, using them to review our benefits, and the ultimate decision to remove the benefit. By doing this, they understood and bought into the change. In fact, many came up to us afterwards to thank us for our honesty and thorough communications approach, and said that had they been in our shoes they would have made the same decision. Perfect, just what we were aiming for!\nLet me end by encouraging you to bring out your ‘why’ in these two ways the next time you develop and deliver change. Use it as your starting point and your focus, and the change will end up being more meaningful, effective and engaging.\nIf you'd like to read more on this topic, here's a blog I wrote explaining how a company communicated change to their employees: https://www.debcohr.com/post/the-hunt-for-the-chocolate-easter-egg\nCommunication\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "LinkedIn's  way to “Perk Up” their wellbeing benefits\nDebra Corey\nMay 10, 2023\n2 min read\nMany companies put innovative perks in place, using these to stand out and differentiate themselves in the war for talent. LinkedIn, a company that has won awards such as Glassdoor’s “Best Places to Work” and Forbes’ “America’s Best Employers,” decided they wanted to look at perks differently. They decided to create “perks with a purpose,” according to Nina McQueen, VP Global Benefits & Employee Experience.\n“Everything we do in benefits must serve a purpose: whether to meet a business need or because it’s  the right thing to do. We would like our programs to have staying power. We want our programs to make a difference in people’s lives.” says McQueen.\nWith this in mind, LinkedIn set out to design a wellbeing perk that would do just that: Make an impact and difference in the lives of their employees. To begin, they simply asked employees,  “What Is the one benefit or perk that would make a difference to you?” The result was a highly unique and personalized approach to perks, a program called PerkUp!\nPerkUp! gives employees an annual allowance that varies by country (it’s $2,000/year in the U.S.). It can be used to spend on perks from an approved list, which originally included gym memberships, personal trainers, fitness classes, massages, childcare, pet-sitting, and dog-walking, and has since been extended to include student loans, tax prep, financial planning, eldercare, and house cleaning. “It focuses on perks that improve employee wellbeing or create convenience to make employees’ lives easier,” says McQueen.\nThe program gives employees the opportunity and flexibility to choose perks that best fit their needs, personalizing it to them. Eligible categories were originally based on what employees indicated mattered most to them via survey feedback, and then fine-tuned after a three-month global pilot.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, a few new categories were added to support the changing needs of their people. One example related to childcare, with virtual tutoring and remote childcare added to help employees face the challenges of managing and juggling work and childcare during the lockdown period. Another example was allowing the purchase of fitness wearables and apps.\nThe program continues to be a huge success, with over 80% of employees globally using the benefit year-on-year.\nIt’s been a win–win for the company and employees, giving the company a benefit that shows employees they care, and providing a competitive advantage (recruiters have said it is a “wow” factor when talking to candidates), and giving employees choice on how they use the allowance. It is a unique and personalized approach to perks. It’s definitely “perked things up” at LinkedIn by delivering a benefit with purpose and meaning.\nIf you'd like to discuss how to design and deliver innovation solutions at your company, please contact me. I'd love to help you come up with something that like LinkedIn, wows and supports your employees!\nWellbeing",

    "content": "4 tasty ways to use informal recognition\nDebra Corey\nJul 5, 2023\n5 min read\nLet me start out by saying that I love, love, love designing formal recognition programs. They’re a great way to deliver what I call the ‘appreciation feeling’ in a formal and structured way, and when done well, do a fab job of bringing culture and values to life as well.\nHowever,\nif employees are truly to feel appreciated, informal recognition also needs to take place.\nTo put it another way - you can't have a PBJ (peanut butter and jelly sandwich) or a BLT (bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwich) with only one of the ingredients, you need them all to deliver a delicious and tasty sandwich!\nBut since too often companies (and managers) rely solely on formal recognition, not understanding all of the great informal tools they have, in this blog I thought I’d share a bit\nabout it from my book titled “\nSee it. Say it. Appreciate it\n!.” Hopefully it will help you and your team understand how to use informal recognition in your recognition “sandwich.”\nWhat is informal recognition?\nAs the name implies, informal recognition is done in more unstructured, free flowing ways at your discretion. It’s more ad hoc, individual and unofficial, something to let loose and have fun with.\nHow do you recognize informally?\nThere’s lots of ways to recognize informally, which is both good and bad, as sometimes you don’t know where to start and what to do. To help you with this, I thought I’d share with you the four categories I group them into when I talk and deliver workshops on recognition. By doing this, it creates a bit of order and structure, and makes it easier to remember and thus action them.\nCategory\n#1\n: Growth/development opportunities\nThe first category is growth and development opportunities, something I’ve used many times as a manager as a way to show my people that I value and appreciate them for not just one contribution, but for their development and overall career.\nFrom sending employees on formal training classes to being able to attend or present at a meeting, to being given a mentor, to shadowing their manager, there are lots of ways to use this as a recognition tool. And by doing it, it sends a message to the recipient that you value and appreciate them, and are committed to supporting their growth and development.\nWhen respondents were asked how they preferred to be recognized for a significant accomplishment, a study14 found that almost half of them (47%) would choose a new growth opportunity. This was significantly higher than a salary increase (23%), a high performance rating (21%) or even a bonus (10%), which shows the importance employees place on their growth and development.\nCategory\n#2\n: Gifts\nThis category includes a wide variety of informal recognition tools, from company-branded merchandise to food, to anything and everything in between. When it comes to gifts, I’ve seen companies and individuals put their own individual mark on them, coming up with ways to show appreciation in wild and wonderful ways.\nAs you select the gifts that are right for your people, keep in mind that it doesn’t need to be costly and it doesn’t need to be complex. It can be as simple as giving them your manager parking spot for the week, or sending them a confetti card, or even giving them a t-shirt that has your company logo on it.\nThe key is finding something that will make them feel appreciated and, like any other form of recognition, align with the contribution they have made (e.g. you don’t give a big gift for a small contribution).\nCategory\n#3\n: Time\nAnother popular form of informal recognition is giving the gift of time. I tend to look at time in two ways, with the first being\ntime off.\nThis is something that’s become more important and more valued by our people based on the new ways of working and renewed thoughts on the importance of time in this fast-paced and challenging world. It can include anything from ad hoc time off to development days to days off to volunteer and give back to an important cause.\nThe other way to give time as a form of informal recognition is by\ngiving your people\nquality time from you\n, showing them that they’re valued by giving them your most precious resource, your time. It can be as simple as taking the time to have a quality conversation with them, spending time with them, or working alongside them on a task or project. You may be surprised at how much your employees appreciate you doing this, showing them how important and valuable they are to you.\nCategory\n#4\n: Communication\nThe final category is communication, which refers to recognizing your people through written and verbal communication practices. Here are a few examples to bring this idea to life:\nInformal recognition postcards\nHandwritten notes\n– Many companies use informal and ad hoc handwritten recognition notes as a way to supplement their formal recognition program.\nOne company I interviewed for my book has what they call a “Celebration Station” set up on each floor that contains recognition postcards. Anyone can select one amongst the range of postcards, write a message, and then send it to someone as a way to informally recognize one another.\nShout outs\n– Another effective way to communicate recognition is through something called a “shout out.” I love these as you can get your entire team involved, shouting out and recognizing colleagues for the great work and support they’ve provided. My husband, who is a senior engineering manager, starts every team call out with shout outs, and he told me that it’s his favorite part of the meeting.\n​\nIt can be as simple (and as inexpensive) as a name\nDuring a recognition workshop with managers I asked them to share what kind of informal recognition they were doing with their teams. One person shared that she goes out of her way to use the names of her employees when she interacts with them. By doing this it makes the employee feel valued, respected and appreciated. As Dale Carnegie said, “\nA person’s name is to him or her the sweetest and most important sound in any language\n.”\nLet me end by pointing out one more thing to help you with informal recognition, and that is to consider the following when selecting and using any of these tools:\nThe action and behavior\n– It’s important to recognize at the appropriate level based on the action and behavior that has been observed. Take the time to consider the scope and impact of the\ninput\n, the action and behavior, before you select the\noutput\n, the tool you will ultimately use to deliver recognition.\nThe person being recognized\n– When it comes to informal recognition, there are so many ways to do it. In fact, one of the first books I read on this topic is titled\n1001 Ways to Reward Employees\n. But with all of these options, it’s even more important to make sure that you take the time to understand personal preferences, understanding how best the individual would feel appreciated and recognized.\nThe person giving recognition\n– And finally, it's important for you to recognize in ways that work for you, reflecting your personality and style. For example, at a previous company, one of the managers was known for recognizing by giving out a bag of handmade cookies that he had baked. This was so personal to him, and something that in turn meant so much to those who received them, and not just because they tasted amazing!\nI encourage you to share and discuss informal recognition alongside your formal recognition ones, remembering that they both have an important role to play in delivering that ‘appreciation feeling.’ And going back to my sandwich analogy, the more ingredients you have, the better it will ultimately taste!\nShould you have any questions on recognition, either formal or informal, please\ncontact me\n, I’d be happy to help.\nTags:\nAppreciation\nInformal recognition\nRecognition",

    "content": "How Honest Burgers are making things #betterthanyouremember\nDebra Corey\nApr 28, 2021\n6 min read\nAs we move to the next phase of the pandemic, companies continue to face challenges and continue to be faced with yet more more difficult decisions to make. One of the most important ones is - where to go next? Do we move back to what we did before, do we move forward to something new, or is it somewhere in between?\nWe’ve already seen this acted out in how companies are managing return to work plans, with some going to 100 percent work from home arrangements, others hybrid, and others bringing everyone back to the workplace. But as we know, there is so much more to it than just this.\nAt Honest Burgers, who's story started in 2010 serving burgers and chips from a marque in a field to today operating in 44 locations across the UK as well as opening their own butchery, they’ve answered this question with their\n#betterthanyouremember\ncampaign.\nFor their customers, it means finding ways to make the food and the overall experience better than they remembered it before the pandemic, and for their 500 employees it means finding better ways to support and engage them as they open up their restaurants and bring employees back to work.\nI interviewed Oli Cavaliero, Head of Employer Brand, who shared with me how they’re doing this with changes to their employee programmes and practices. What makes their approach so special, and why I’m excited to share it with you, is because it not only aligns with the theme of their campaign, but with their mission and culture that is built around honesty and trust.\nHere are just four of the many changes they have made to make them\n#betterthanyouremember\n:\n1. New employee contract\nOne of the first things that Honest Burgers did as part of this campaign was to change their employee contracts. \"Our old contract felt one-sided, and it only really protected Honest Burgers. So we changed it to protect our teammates too\" said Cavaliero.\n\"The contract looks and reads like us now - it suits our culture. We don't want a 10-page document with every bit of detail telling you why you should turn up for work on time. We're adults right? Each area has a supporting document as well as details about sick pay, maternity/paternity, and perks on our knowledge library, so if somebody wants to read more into a specific area, they do so at a click of a button.\"\nHere is Honest Burger's new contract, which I'm sure you'll agree is absolutely \"betterthanyouremember\":\nIn addition to changing the physical contract, they also felt it was important to change some of the elements of the contract itself to be better. One way is by having\nguaranteed hours for everyone\n, meaning nobody has a zero-hour contract (unless they ask to), and ensuring that\nnobody is on minimum wage\n, regardless of age or position. Amazing!\n2. New employee handbook\nEmployee handbooks can be some of the most disengaging documents created by organisations, being designed around the assumption that every employee is a potential fraudster. And, as we write in our book ‘\nBuild it: The rebel playbook for employee engagement\n’, “If we want our employees to be engaged and on our side, fighting our battles and winning for the customer, we have to start with the premise that we’re not adversaries, but we’re actually on the same team.”\nThat’s exactly why Honest Burgers made changes to their handbook, removing what I call ‘unnecessary and disengaging’ parts. They worked with a solicitor to determine what really needs to go into it, stripping it back to make it better and build trust into each and every word, going from 12 pages to just 10 bullet points!\n“Our Employee Handbook looked boring, it was 12 pages too long and we didn't think it sounded like us. We wanted a one-page document that outlines what we'd expect from being a good human at Honest, and what you’d expect from your teammates” said Cavaliero.\nHere is Honest Burger's new employee handbook, which again I'm sure you'll agree is absolutely \"betterthanyouremember\":\nThey’ve changed it to something they can be proud of and wear on their sleeves quite literally \t\tas new employees receive a sweatshirt that has five of the ten points written on each sleeve.\n3. Four-week paid sabbatical\nOne area that companies have been addressing and handling in their own way is the matter of time, answering the question of how to give employees time to recharge and recover from the challenges they’ve been facing during the pandemic. Some companies have given employees an extra day off, others have created no-meeting Fridays, all finding the solution that is best for their workforce.\nHonest Burgers have addressed this in their own way by creating a special four-week paid sabbatical benefit, which is two weeks more than their usual two-week limit. When asked why they decided to do this, Cavaliero said “With almost 70% of our workforce not being UK nationals, they were not able to travel home to visit family and friends over the last year, and have been missing out on this. We wanted to give employees this extended time to catch up with family or friends, or just take in the sights of London.” So until 2023, employees will be able to take up to four weeks of their unused holidays to do just that.\nWhen asked how they will manage the challenges of this, especially as they are a hospitality business, Cavaliero said “We felt it was the right thing to do for our people, so we’ll face the challenges and build in the processes we need to manage it. It goes back to the foundation of our business where we still cut our chips fresh each day, not doing frozen ones that may be easier and quicker, which is just not us.”\n4. Paid private medical cover\nAnother key area that companies are addressing is wellbeing, answering the question of how best to support the changing (and increasing) wellbeing needs of their workforce. Again, companies have been doing this in a variety of ways, from giving time off as mentioned in the previous point, to putting in place online wellbeing offerings to providing wellbeing apps.\nOne way that Honest Burgers have addressed this is by putting in place a new employee benefit that is unheard of in the hospitality sector, providing all employees with paid private medical cover. And it’s not just any private medical cover, but one through Vitality which has a proactive approach to wellbeing by encouraging employees to stay healthy by educating and rewarding them for healthy living.\n\"Personally I don't think there is any more important perk than supporting your team to take care of their physical and mental health. Vitality is a perfect partner for us as our teams can access free GP, physio and talking therapy sessions. As well as a range of activities to keep healthy, blogs to read, videos to watch and the more you use your membership, the more free stuff you get - anything from a coffee every week to a free Apple Watch\" said Cavaliero.\nThese examples from Honest Burgers have shown how they’ve answered these important questions as they move into the future. To help you answer these questions for yourself, here are three things to consider:\nBe led by your mission and culture\nOne of the things I write and speak about often, is the need to do things in your own way, aligning with your purpose, mission, values and culture. That’s exactly what Honest Burgers have done, even if it meant making the more difficult decisions, staying true and focussed on their mission, culture and ultimately supporting their strategy of\n#betterthanyouremember\n.\nBuild in trust and engagement\nAnother thing that I am absolutely passionate about is the importance of building trust and engagement into everything we do. As we make these important decisions, take the opportunity to challenge yourself by asking - does this show my employees I trust them or does it show them that I don’t? As I often say, too often we develop our policies and programmes for the less than 1% that will abuse them. Focus on the 99%, and at the same time, gain the important trust and engagement of your people.\nBe brave\nAnd finally, and something I believe in so strongly that often when I do presentations I put on my red superhero cape to make this point, is that it’s important  that as we move forward we are brave. Honest Burgers have done this in the three examples I shared, taking bold steps even when it meant making things more challenging for them to manage, but did it because it was the right thing for them to do. So put on your cape, whatever colour it may be, and be brave in how you answer these questions and what you do next.\nSo go out there and make it\n#betterthanyouremember\nfor your people and your business!\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "3 ways we piss off our employees - Part 2\nDebra Corey\nJan 22, 2019\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nJan 31, 2021\nIf you asked your employees for a list of things that really piss them off, I’m sure they wouldn’t be shy in rattling off a few. But let me ask you – how many of these do you know about and how many of these physically and/or emotionally drive your employees away from your company?\nThis is what I talked about in my previous\nblog\n, where I shared three things that really piss off my 17 year-old daughter Chloe, who is new to the world of work.\nIn this blog I’ve added three more to the list, either from her or from others who’ve shared their ‘piss list’ with me. And since I’m a solutions-oriented person, I’ve listed my thoughts on what we can do to make sure they don’t happen.\n1. Not being taken serious\nIn the first part of this\nblog series\nI said that appreciation is something we all crave and something that pisses us off if we don’t get it. I focused on recognition, which although important, doesn’t tell the whole story when it comes to feeling appreciated.\nThe second part of feeling appreciated is believing that we’re being taken serious for our contributions.\n“We want to feel that we aren’t just being listened to, but that we’re being heard.”\nWe want to be heard for what we have to say, regardless of our age, our gender, our experience, or anything else that makes others feel that we don’t deserve to be taken seriously.\nThe solution is to start with the premise that we all have something valuable to contribute, and not to dismiss or rule out anyone’s opinions. I know it sounds obvious, but I can’t tell you the number of times I’ve had this happen to me, with my ideas being dismissed or someone else taking credit for it, or have seen it happening to others.\nCreate an environment that encourages and supports this kind of culture, showing that anything else will not be tolerated. And remember, if you don’t, another company will, and you’ll lose your employees to them.\n2. Having to live with crap processes\nFace it, we all live in a world where we have to follow or manage crap processes. But let me ask you a question – why? Why should we settle for this?\nIn talking to Chloe, she cited many examples of crap processes that she had to follow in her first job, which ended up being one of the key reasons she left. Why put up with something that makes no sense and makes it difficult, if not impossible, to do a good job?\nThe solution to this is to take a step back and take the time to examine your processes. Sometimes we’ve been doing them for so long that we’ve learned to just live with them, so bring in people who are new to them or even not involved, and have them help you re-shape and deliver a more effective and engaging process. Don’t let crap processes force your employees to leave you!\n3. Creating bogus goals\nThis last one came from someone who wrote to me and will remain anonymous. They told me that the thing that pisses them off the most is when their manager creates bogus goals at the end of the year, doing so just so they have something to ‘evaluate’ their performance on.\nI put the word evaluate in quotes, for we all know that there is no way to truly evaluate performance when the goal hasn’t even been known by the employee. It would be like me showing up to run a half marathon and on the day of the race being told that you have to run a marathon. Really? How do you expect this to happen?\nThe solution to this one is simple – create and agree goals at the start of the year, discuss and change them throughout the year, and evaluate based on these.

    "content": "Breaking down the barriers of wellbeing at work\nDebra Corey\nApr 16, 2021\n5 min read\nWellbeing at work is an area that has leapfrogged to the top of the priority list for many companies, and will most likely hold this coveted position for many years to come. While this is great, something that many of us have been pushing for, it comes with its own set of challenges – how do we break down the barriers to let wellbeing ‘in’, overcoming many of the stigmas that are associated with it so that our employees (and businesses) reap the benefits?\nTo answer this question, let me share with you a story of how one company has been tackling this challenge, and then share some actions for you to consider at your company.\nThe company is Fair Ways, a charity-owned children’s service provider in the south of England that provides a broad range of services to vulnerable young people in care. And the story begins when Harriett Whitren-Jones, Head of HR, joined in April 2020 with a mission of bringing wellbeing to life.\n“Fair Ways aspires to have employees that are healthy and engaged to ensure they remain in their best self at work. It is more important than ever that we provide our employees with an environment that encourages and enables healthy lives so they can make choices that support positive wellbeing, and can thrive inside and outside of work. We’ve developed a wellbeing framework that goes beyond the legal standards, striving to provide our employees with the tools, knowledge and surroundings to make improvements to their own health and wellbeing, in turn, helping them to take the benefits to our service users and into the wider community” says Whitren-Jones.\n“We wanted to move to a proactive approach to wellbeing, not just focussing on fixing problems but raising awareness and giving our employees the tools to address them before the pieces have to be picked up. We wanted to ensure that culturally wellbeing became a part of who we are and how we talk in our everyday language and lives, reducing the stigma of mental health.”\nAnd given the critical services that they provide, which have only increased in volume and impact during the pandemic, this mission and this approach is absolutely essential to support the people who provide so much support themselves.\nThey started on their journey by introducing a program called \"\nBe your best self\",\nwhich brings together and links all of the elements of wellbeing in a holistic and meaningful way. Here are a few elements of the programme:\nCommunity platform\n– Fair Ways have created a community platform to bring people together in a variety of ways that create that sense of belonging and support that is so critical from a wellbeing perspective. From book clubs, to webinars, to nutritional advice to exercise classes, they’re constantly looking for ways to help employees build strength and resiliency through community activities.\nTraining\n– A key element of their proactive approach is through training, giving their workforce the awareness and tools to help them know what to do and where to go for additional help and support. They’ve done this extensively with these three groups:\nMental health first aiders\n– they’ve trained 27 mental health first aiders as a way to bring more knowledge and support across the organisation.\nManagement\n– they’ve put every employee with line management responsibility through a half day training session with MHFA UK as they felt it was critical that their managers have the knowledge and tools to recognise and support their team’s mental wellbeing.\nEmployees\n– and finally, in order to touch every employee with this important topic, they invited an external wellbeing practitioner to attend all team meetings to promote positive mental wellbeing and help employees understand how to support themselves and others through a variety of tools and techniques.\nTherapists\n– Fair Ways directly employs a broad range of therapeutic and clinical professionals for the young people they support, which staff can access as well. These services include restorative group supervision, music therapy, CBT, family therapy and more.\nFriday Show\n– Adding a bit of levity to their wellbeing approach, they’ve introduced something called “The Friday Show” which two of their employees run for an hour every Friday afternoon for employees and families. They do fun activities such as quizzes, go grab rounds, and talent shows together to include and support one another.\nWellbeing Hampers\n– In early 2021 they sent packages to their employees as a way to support their wellbeing and to thank them for all of their hard work during these challenging times. The packages were done in-house and contained a variety of lovely to support their self care and wellbeing, from bath salts, to face masks, to love heart sweets, to sleep spray. In addition, it contained a letter from their COO to thank them and their families, and to remind them to look after themselves.\nIt’s still early days in their wellbeing journey, but they’ve already found that employees are talking more openly and are engaging with the programme, showing that they’re on their way to achieve their mission. “Wellbeing is becoming a part of our culture, of who we are, what we represent, and where we want to be, bleeding through into everything we do – we really do ‘put people before profit’” said Whitren-Jones\nAs you can see, even a company like Fair Ways, where their workforce deals with mental health on a daily basis, has barriers to break down when it comes to wellbeing. They’ve shared some great ways they’re doing it, and here are some additional tips, or what I call the 3 A’s, that will help you get that sledgehammer out and start breaking down the barriers at your company:\nAwareness\nIt all starts with awareness, helping employees be self-aware so they can recognise their own symptoms before they become a problem. At Fair Ways, this is a big part of their proactive approach, putting in place programmes to make sure that the “walls” are not built in the first place.\nThis can, as I’m sure you’ve seen, be a challenge as you’ll first need your employees to take that first step, because, as the expression goes “you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make them drink it”. The more you can do to make the ‘water’ so enticing over and over again that they want and need to drink it, the better chance you have for them to take that first step and take a ‘sip’.\nAvailability\nOnce you have the initial awareness, just as important is the availability. Think of it like entering a maze – the awareness encourages you to enter it, but if sources of help and support are not available you’ll face walls and obstacles that make you stuck in one place, unable to escape the maze (your challenges).\nAt Fair Ways they implemented a holistic approach to the sources of help and support provided, in both serious and fun ways, meeting the differing needs and situations faced by their workforce. They also make the sources available in easy and engaging ways, which is equally important.\nAssistance\nAnd finally, and going back to the maze scenario, if your employees are going to get through it, it’s not just the support from physical aides mentioned in the previous point, but the emotional support and assistance. Think of it like your personal cheerleaders, encouraging you to move past your challenges, listening to you, pointing you back to tools available, and being there until you get through the maze or at least make an important step forward in the process.\nFair Ways are doing this by ensuring they have a variety of assistance mechanisms through well-trained managers, therapists and mental health first aiders. With such an extensive team, they’re assisting the varying and changing needs of their workforce.\nI encourage you to think through and plan against these 3 A’s, taking inspiration from the approach that Fair Ways has adopted in their wellbeing journey. By doing this you can break down the barriers of wellbeing, building a strong and more resilient workforce and organization.\nThis blog was first published on\nHRD Connect\n.\nWellbeing",

    "content": "6 tips for getting the balance right in strategic goal-setting\nDebra Corey\nMar 19, 2021\n4 min read\nBalance (both in business and in life) is so important. In fact, it feeds into just about everything we do, from managing our work-life balance, to injecting balance into our workplace initiatives. But I think it’s time to address another crucially important (and yet often neglected) form of this:\nbalance in strategic goal-setting.\nI was reminded of this in my personal life recently. When I was taking an online spin class, the instructor started out by talking about goals, and the importance of finding ones that work for you. I thought about this for a moment, and realized that even within the context of day-to-day exercise, I actually have multiple goals across the two programmes I am enrolled in:\nThe first one is based on\npoints\n: if you get 40 points in a week, you get perks such as a free drink at a local coffee shop or a free online movie\nThe other is based on\nachievement badges\n: you receive different badges for things such as working out x number of days a week or month, or riding x number of miles.\nAs you can see, by having these different goals and measures of success it creates a more balanced workout. If I only had the first goal, all I would care about is the number of workouts each week: the quantity, and not the quality. The same logic works in the reverse scenario.\nThis also applies to goal-setting. It’s just as important to build in balance so our people and our business get the right results. Those following approaches such as the balanced scorecard and SMART goals are already doing this to some degree, but in this article I’d like to\ntake it to the next level\nand\nshare some tips\non balance in goal-setting, using my experience with exercise as an analogy.\n1. Have short and long-term goals\nOne of the things I love about the online exercise company I use is their wide array of badges and challenges, ranging from a badge you receive for your first workout, to one for completing a certain number of miles for the entire year. By having both short and long-term goals, it gives me ongoing motivation as well as regular feelings of accomplishment.\nToo often when it comes to goal-setting, we focus on the big picture; those goals that need to be done by the end of year. And while this is important, it’s also important to think about if there are also any specific short-term goals. If not, it can pay to build in short-term milestones so that employees feel that sense of accomplishment.\n2. Have well-rounded goals\nIf all I ever did was spin classes, then I wouldn’t have a very balanced exercise regime. By adding yoga, strength and meditation classes, I’m working my entire body and mind, and thus meeting my overall health and exercise objectives.\nThis approach should also be taken into consideration when setting goals. The balanced scorecard approach introduces this thought process by focusing on several categories: financial, customer, internal process, and learning and growth. But that said, I’d also encourage you to explore if there are other measures or “classes” to be taken to drive and support the individual’s development and performance.\n3. Have goals that bring you out of your comfort zone\nIf we’re ever going to develop and improve, we need to push ourselves. We need to “get out of our saddle”, as they say in spin class; it’s all about getting out of your comfort zone. Inevitably, this can’t happen all of the time, or we’d surely burn out and eventually give up, but it should happen from time-to-time to help us improve and grow.\nThese “out of the saddle” types of goals should be built into your overall goals, creating balance between those that are in your comfort zone and those that aren’t. Together they create a balanced and more meaningful “workout”.\n4. Have goals that focus on your “posture”\nAnother key mandate in spin class is for us to focus on our posture. Quite simply, if you get it wrong, you can injure yourself, and thus your goals will be even harder to attain.\nThe same is true with goal-setting: it’s important to consider the ‘how’ and not just the ‘what’. Often, this is done by building in your values and behaviours. Much like posture, this ensures that you’re achieving the goal in the most safe and effective way, aligning with and driving your company’s mission and purpose.\n5. Have a flexible approach to setting (and resetting) goals\nSometimes when I start a workout I may have one goal in mind, but depending on how I’m feeling and how I’m doing, I may need to adapt the goal. This isn’t giving up, it’s recognizing that sometimes things change, and that it’s better to have a new goal than to give up entirely.\nMany companies did this in 2020, having their employees revisit their goals, which is exactly what needs to happen on an ongoing basis. Keep in mind that a key part of goals is to motivate, so if the current goal is not doing this, then take a step back and change it if required.\n6. Find the right motivators\nFinally, it’s important to understand and find the right motivators for each person when building goals. For example, I’m motivated by achieving the badges and challenges, whereas my husband is motivated by achieving a certain spot on the leaderboard.\nI know it’s not always realistic to always build goals around motivators, but we should still try to find some room for this. For example, I’m motivated by being creative, so if I had a goal to build a new recognition programme, it would make sense to build in something about me working with the creative team to design the branding and communication material.\nSo there you go, six tips on how you and your workforce can and should balance your goals. I do hope you find this helpful in driving strategic goals for your people and your business.\nThis blog was originally posted in\nHRD Connect\n.\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "Benefits that really matter - Reward Gateway’s Domestic Violence Protection Programme\nDebra Corey\nJun 9, 2021\n5 min read\nEmployee benefits come in many forms, with organisations putting ones in place to meet the needs of their workforce and often, to stand out as an employer of choice. And when done well, it not only helps to attract and retain talent, but sends a strong message to employees that their company understands their needs and genuinely cares for and supports them.\nAn example of one such benefit is Reward Gateway’s Domestic Violence Protection Programme that they recently implemented in their offices around the world. To learn more about it, I interviewed Catrin Lewis, Head of Global Engagement and Internal Communications, where she shared why it was put in place, and how it was designed.\nQuestion: Why did you decide to put this new benefit programme in place?\nCatrin: We have a range of benefits to support our employees throughout various stages of their life, from parental leave to family leave to annual holiday entitlement. With the number of domestic abuse cases gradually increasing over recent years, especially throughout the pandemic, and the limited funding and resources for those impacted to quickly get help, we felt it was important to add this programme now to support employees who may face this unfortunate situation during their life.\nWe recognised that unfortunately in some cases relationships can break down and this can lead to abuse and violence, not just physical, but emotional and/or psychological too. We believe that the safety and wellbeing of our people must come first, and this programme aims to support them through such challenges from speaking out to establishing a new normal outside of their abusive relationship.\nQuestion: Can you explain how in a previous job you had direct dealings with domestic violence?\nCatrin: I worked in a Police Control Room for two and a half years where every other call was related to domestic violence. During this time I spoke with individuals experiencing all sorts of abuse, where I learned that something is going on behind every door, often not what you’d expect. This has always stayed with me, and for this reason I was committed to doing something about it.\nI’ve spoken first hand to victims and perpetrators from all walks of life. I believe that domestic violence has no boundaries, and that it can impact everyone.\nQuestion: What is the domestic violence protection programme?\nCatrin: The programme has three key areas that support an individual through a challenging time when they are faced with domestic violence. They include:\n1. Support and advice from local and national agencies\nThe majority of domestic violence cases are not reported to police. There are a huge amount of blockers for a victim to be able to speak up. And since Reward Gateway works hard to empower their people to Speak Up, one of their company values, they wanted to establish ways to provide extra support to report.\nThis part of the programme shares support and advice from local and national agencies, as many don’t know where to go, and often going to the police is not the right and/or the only solution. The aim of this is to give employees access to advice on financial, health and housing advice as well as legal assistance specially focused for victims of domestic abuse, giving them what they need to understand and manage the situation.\nAny company can do this at absolutely no cost  - put it on your website, put it on posters, do whatever you can to signpost where employees can go for advice and support.\n2. Ten days fully paid leave\nThe next part of the programme is the provision of ten additional days of fully paid leave to help employees get away from an abusive environment and seek refuge. Inspired by New Zealand, where legislation was put in place in April 2019 making it legal for all companies to provide this, this is considered special leave, and is outside of standard holiday and sick leave entitlements.\nWe felt it was important to separate this time off from annual leave, which I consider wellbeing leave, a time when you rest and enjoy life.\nThe New Zealand legislation was the result of seven years of work by Green MP Jan Logie, who worked in a women’s refuge before she became a politician. “Part of this initiative is getting a whole-of-society response. We don’t just leave it to police but realise we all have a role in helping victims. It is also about changing the cultural norms and saying ‘we all have a stake in this and it is not OK’,” said Logie.\n3. Financial support for legal action\nAnd finally, Reward Gateway provides financial support to any employee wanting to take legal action against any perpetrator of domestic violence.\nThis goes above and beyond to support employees, but in speaking with specialists in family law, we learned that although employees can get free legal aid, because of the small number of lawyers specialising in this area and the increased numbers requiring it they can wait up to three months. A lot can happen during this time and it can be a very dangerous period for the victim, so we wanted to provide the option for private legal support, removing the financial friction and challenges and increasing safety for the employee.\nEmployees can confidentially request financial support from the fund, with the monies being given as a gift, so no repayment is required.\nThere is complete confidentiality with this as well as with other parts of the programme as we want our employees to know that we have their safety, wellbeing and future as our highest priority and will handle any incident reported to us with the highest sensitivity and absolution confidentiality.\nQuestion: What reaction have you had from your workforce about this benefit?\nCatrin: The reaction from employees has been extremely positive, from saying how proud they are of a benefit that has such a big impact on people’s lives, to showing genuine commitment and support to them.\nIt shows our employees that our mission of ‘making the world a better place to work’ considers the wider wellbeing of our employees. Though the benefit may not see incredibly high engagement figures, and I’d not want it to, it could be the benefit that saves someone's life. With many of our employees now working from home, it’s our health and safety responsibility to ensure they are protected from fear and intimidation while working. No one is going to be able to enjoy their time at work if they spend the time in fear of going home, or wondering what’s going to happen to them at the end of the day. We can show them that they are not alone and we will support them every step of the way in making the hard decision to leave and change their life.\nQuestion: And finally, you explained that a key reason for sharing this with me and others is as a way to influence other businesses, having a bigger reach on what is a national problem. What do you want to say to those reading this about what steps they can take?\nCatrin: The smallest thing can make a huge impact. Don’t let the thought of no budget put you off. Simply signposting your employees to domestic abuse hotlines could be the act that saves someone. Explaining what coercive control might be the messaging someone needs to read to understand that their situation is not what a healthy, happy relationship looks like.\nDomestic violence is incredibly isolating. It can be hard to know who to trust and who to turn to for help. Hold out your hand and let your employees know that you are there and that you recognise this is an issue that affects everyone.\nHere are links to some websites providing access to free information and assistance:\nhttps://www.nationaldahelpline.org.uk/\nhttps://www.hestia.org/brightsky\nhttps://www.mankind.org.uk/help-for-victims/\nThank you so much to Catrin for sharing this with us, and I do hope that it inspires you to address this important issue at your organisation.\nBenefits",

    "content": "Four way to help working parents with home schooling\nDebra Corey\nJan 23, 2021\n5 min read\nWith the new lockdown rules, many parents must feel like it’s Groundhog Day, as they’re right back to where they were almost a year ago balancing the challenges of work and those of home-schooling their children.\nRecognising the strain this is putting on their employees, many companies are taking steps to support their working parents by allowing more flexible work schedules and providing additional time off. And whilst these steps will make a significant difference and impact, they are not enough as time alone does not fully ease the burden and relieve the pressure these working and teaching parents face.\nA Boston Consulting Group\nstudy\nof working parents across five countries found that 60% were not able to find alternative care following school and daycare closures. This has resulted in parents spending an additional 27 hours each week on household chores, childcare, and education, on top of what they were doing previously — which is roughly the equivalent of working a second job.\nSo what more can you do? Here are four things to consider as you develop your plans to help and support your working parents during lockdown and even beyond:\n1. Take flexibility to the next gear\nOver the last year, many companies have found a flexible approach to work absolutely key to how they run their business and how they support their workforce. During this lockdown I’d like to suggest that you take it that one step further, going into the next ‘gear’ to support your working parents.\nThink about flexibility in respect to time, but also in respect to work. If, as the study above shows, they have less hours in the day because they’re now being asked to assume teaching responsibilities, is there anything you can do to reduce their workload in the short-term? By the way, this same study found that 50% of respondents felt their performance at work decreased based on additional responsibilities, so by addressing workload you’ll not only have a positive impact on the sanity of your working parents, but also on their performance for your company.\n2. Understand their different needs\nHelp and support required will look very different depending on your employee’s individual situations both at work and at home. For some, time and flexibility as mentioned already are enough. For those who feel nervous or uncomfortable teaching, they’ll need support re-learning what they studied many years ago as well as the skills (and patience) to teach. For those who lack the experience of balancing conflicting and challenging demands, they’ll need support developing these skills. The key, as with anything involving your people, is to start by understanding their different needs.\nOnce you do this, it’s time to develop your plans, and to help you with this part of the process, here are four examples of what companies are doing:\nCreate working parent support groups/networks so that those facing similar challenges can support one another. It not only helps them feel that they’re not alone, but it provides an opportunity to share advice and ideas for teaching methods and activities.\nLend employees laptops, as done at\nCheckatrade\n, so that their children have the technology to join online classes and do their lessons at home.\nCreate activity packs for employees, as\nMissguided\nis doing with their ‘Dream Big’ creative thinking programme. They consist of weekly activity packs built around the ‘Think.Draw.Play’ concept, and with a rainbow theme. They’re available to colleagues as well as to their family and friends, and can be printed at home, or for those that don't have access to a printer/ technology, they’re being posted to homes.\nHold challenges and competitions, as\nTeleperformance\nis doing, keeping children busy with weekly themed activity packs and competitions. From superheroes, to space, to dinosaurs, they’re planning a variety of ways to keep the kiddies busy and engaged.\n3. Share information and resources\nFollowing on from the last point about helping parents with their teaching, one way this is being done is by providing them with information and resources. As parents are once again being thrust into this new and very challenging role, anything you can share to help them learn these new skills and have resources to do it effectively would truly be appreciated. It saves them both time and frustration, both equally important! Here are three examples of ways to do this:\nProvide employees with links to free resources such as\nTwinkl,\nwho have products such\nTwinkl Go\nand\nLearning Hub\nthat include online libraries of educational digital games, videos, audio books and more that bring learning to life, and timetables of activities to help working parents both educate and entertain their children at no cost to your company.\nCreate a children’s learning hub within your existing employee learning platform, which is what\nGetronics\ndid in creating their global Kid’s Zone. They created it during the first lockdown in March 2020, and have been adding to and evolving it ever since to have sections relating to learning, playing, crafts, mental health and even cooking to educate and entertain their workforce. It was built and is maintained in-house, and has been found to be high impact and low effort, which is always a great combination.\nAnd finally, for any of your employees with budding space cadets, you can share this\nlink\nto NASA’s Kids’ Club, which has lots of fun games and activities relating to all things outer space.\n4. Provide teaching ‘holidays’\nAnd finally, we all love holidays, providing us with a way to take a step away from work. The same is true when it comes to teaching, with our working parents needing to take a step away from these new and challenging responsibilities.\nYou can do this in many ways, and the good news is that most cost you absolutely nothing. A great example is having storytelling sessions, where employees volunteer to read to the children through a virtual platform. It’s not only fun for the children, but who doesn’t love acting out all of the characters in these books? I even heard about how at one company the CEO is the one who reads the children the stories, how lovely is that?\nAnother example is to run online kids clubs, which is what\nAtos\nand\nZoom\ndid in the summer when children were home for the holidays and needed to be entertained whilst their parents were working. This is something you can do yourself like Atos did, having a group of volunteers who develop and run the activities, or bring in companies who can do this for you.\nWell that’s it from me, I do hope this has provided you with ideas of how best to support your working parents. And if you need one more, please find below five tips for working parents/teachers from education expert Ollie, from Twinkl. Please feel free to share them with your working parents.\nTips for working parents:\nLike any good teacher, staying flexible and adaptable is key, so if how you planned your teaching begins to go awry . . . don't panic.\nGo with the flow, if your children are loving the activity then keep it going, even if it lasts longer than you'd planned. If they're not enjoying it or finding it too easy/hard, then don't be afraid to cut it short and try something else.\nDon't put too much pressure on yourself and the plans you've made.\nDon’t feel like you have to know everything. If you get asked a question that stumps you, use it as inspiration and go research the answer together and explore further.\nLet your child lead you and then jump on opportunities to create a project on that topic or quiz them on what they've found out.\nProvided by Ollie from Twinkl\nThis blog originally appeared on\nHR Zone\n.\nEmployee Engagement\nWellbeing",

    "content": "Why, when and how to rethink recognition during these challenging times\nDebra Corey\nMay 4, 2020\n5 min read\nUpdated:\nDec 19, 2020\nI’ve been a part of my village’s Facebook group for years. But since it was mostly filled with snarky comments about what so and so did or what so and so said, I hardly ever looked at it. But since the lockdown things have changed dramatically. It’s become a place where my fellow villagers share achievements and share what they’re grateful for. It’s become a place where people go to stay connected and to stay positive. And it’s a place to share and celebrate personal wins and wins of others (e.g. who’s survived the coronavirus even if we don’t know them). It gives us strength, it gives us hope, and it helps us cope!\nI’m sharing this story because I believe it’s an important place to start when it comes to talking about recognition, as recognition can and does have similar outcomes to this new Facebook group. It celebrates wins, it connects us to one another, and it makes us feel stronger and more positive. And if there ever was a time for these outcomes, it’s now, in a world where we’re all filled with uncertainty, challenges and a sense of isolation. Recognition, like this Facebook group, can give us strength, can give us hope, and can help us not just cope, but thrive.\n“In the face of demoralization, gratitude has the power to heal. In the face of despair, gratitude has the power to bring hope.” Robert Emmons, University of California, Davis.\nBut like my new Facebook group, if you want recognition to be effective in these challenging times, you need to rethink and possibly change your recognition programme. Here are three questions to ask yourself:\n1. Why?\nThe first thing to rethink is the why, so why are you recognising your people? In the past the main objectives have been so that your workforce feels appreciated, valued, and to drive performance. And while these are still important, what may be even more important in the current climate are outcomes mentioned earlier such as feeling connected and more resilient.\nStart by evaluating what your people and your business need, and if your current recognition programme doesn’t support these needs, quickly adapt it. Here are two examples of how companies have done this:\nAt Missguided, a retail organisation, they launched new “Positivity” eCards with the goal of keeping people connected while working from home with their strategic behaviours. “From ‘virtual hugs’ to ‘high fives from home’, we’ve slightly tweaked our already popular eCard scheme to make sure we had designs and messages suited to the way people are currently working. We wanted to give our people another tool to say thank you, keep morale high and just simply let someone know they are thinking of them” said Glenn Grayson, Internal Communications and Engagement Partner.\nWithin the last two weeks over 80 of the new designs have been shared amongst colleagues, with ‘Sending you virtual hugs’ being clearly the most popular sentiment.  And to keep the momentum going and the ideas fresh, they’re introducing new designs each week, the latest design ‘Sending you a virtual brew’ already becoming super popular.\nAt Reward Gateway, an HR technology company, they implemented three new eCards. “We wanted to ensure that employees who were role modelling great work from home practises and supporting others to do so would be recognised for their efforts in making this change an easier one” said Catrin Lewis, Head of Global Engagement and Communications.\nThe first card (You make WFH a better place to work) aligns with their company mission to ‘make the world a better place to work’, showing employees that they're still on a path to deliver on this. This was coupled with two eCards on friendship, enabling employees to bond and build social connections in a digital world while the office is out of reach.\n2. When?\nThe next thing to rethink is the when, considering when you’re recognising your people. In a world that’s changing by the minute, when a day feels like a week or a month, you can’t wait to recognise people monthly, quarterly or annually. It needs to keep up with this new pace, helping your workforce feel connected and appreciated exactly when they need it.\nEncourage your managers and your workforce to recognise ‘in the moment’ achievements, recognising those small wins that are helping your people and business survive in these challenging times. And, as mentioned above, adapt your recognition mindset and recognition phrases to reflect and capture these new moments. Consider phrases such as those shared above – ‘sending a virtual hug’, ‘high fiving from home’, ‘you make WFH a better place to work’ – to get the message and feelings across to your workforce. Let them know that every small impact they contribute is making a difference, and that you appreciate them for it.\n3. How?\nLast but certainly not least, is to take a step back and rethink how you’re recognising your workforce. With people losing jobs and/or being put on furlough, ask yourself if you should be recognising financially or if a simple thank you would be more appropriate? Remember, it’s the thought that counts, especially now.\nThree ways you can do this are with eCards, by having a separate recognition instant messaging channel, or by doing shout outs at the end of your virtual team meetings. These all deliver timely and effective recognition with the added bonus of costing absolutely nothing to do.\nIn ending, let me wish you all the best in using recognition as a tool to help your people and your business connect, stay strong and be their best.

    "content": "Why bad bosses truly do ruin lives\nDebra Corey\nSep 20, 2018\n4 min read\nUpdated:\nFeb 22, 2024\nWe all have a story,  you know the one, where you haven’t liked or gotten on with a manager, where they’ve upset you, or where they just haven’t treated you fairly.\nBut that’s OK, you put on a stiff upper lip and just get on with it, right?!  But what happens when you just can’t do it any longer? What happens when this manager makes your life a living hell? When they basically . . . . ruin your life?\nAccording to a study by\nBambooHR\n, 44% of employee said they leave because of their boss.  The top three characteristics of their boss that made them leave are:  management style (37%), condescending attitude (30%) and mean or had a bad temper (30%).\nLooking at this data I have a strong, and sad, feeling that I may not be alone when saying that I’ve been in this situation. That I’ve had, as we say in our\nbook\n, a “bad boss who’s ruined my life”. And since work doesn’t end when you walk out the door at the end of the work day, it’s also ruined the lives of others, our families. Well at least it almost did, until I decided to take control and leave this bad situation.\nI remember exactly the day when I made the decision to leave. I’d come home after another horrible day at work, where my boss had made me feel inadequate and incompetent, and decided to take a quick walk around the block to pull myself together before I began cooking dinner and spending time with the family.  I quickly said hello, announced that I’d be right back, and began walking around the block, sobbing as I went along.\nAbout 5 minutes into the walk my daughter, who was 11 at the time, came running up beside me to ask if I was OK, as she was concerned about me as I had left the house so abruptly. She put her arms around me and told me that everything would be OK and that if I was unhappy that I should leave, and that the family would be fine even if I didn’t have a job and we didn’t have any money. As I listened to my sweet and sensitive daughter, I thought to myself, what kind of mother and role model was I being to her?\nSo I decided that enough was enough, that I needed to show my daughter that I was indeed strong and confident and that I wasn’t (and she shouldn’t) have to put up with such a painful situation. And so I walked away from a job and company that I loved, and from my bad boss.\nI wanted to share this story for a few reasons.\nThe first is so that others know that they’re not alone if they find themselves into this situation.\nThe second is to say that you do have a part to play, and control over the situation, and that it’s important to act on it before it does indeed ruin your life and the lives of others. I know at the time it seemed that I had absolutely no control, feeling like I was living in either a disaster or horror film, with everything being a blur happening around and to me. But that is so not true, I did have control.\nI could have found a way to get help, either through my boss or through someone else, speaking up for the challenges I was having and finding help and a way to get out of the mess. And I could have left, which as I said is what I ultimately did. I know this is hard to do, for if you’re like me and you don’t like giving up, giving up is sometimes all that you can and should do.\nMy final reason for sharing this, and this is confession time, is to say that I’ve been on the other side of this, so the one who was the bad boss.\nAt the time I didn’t realize it, but that’s no excuse, I still did it. I wanted to admit this for I believe that many managers may find themselves in this same situation, not understanding or realizing the impact they have on their employees. I certainly did not at the time, and I’m sure that my bad boss did not as well as I hid much of what I was going through from them. I believe this because I’m confident that no manager ever goes to work thinking, “what can I do to ruin the lives of my employees?”.\nIf we gave managers more understanding and more support in being a better, a more compassionate and empathetic boss, I’m confident that they would have a more positive impact on the lives of their employees.\nTo help with this, here are links to two amazing videos from two amazing women –\nBrené Brown\non empathy vs sympathy and\nKim Scott\non Radical Candor.\nI’d highly suggest weaving them into any and all of your development programs. So with that, I want to wish you all the best in being the best boss you can be, developing the best bosses at your company, and to send my sincere apologies to the people that I negatively impacted while I was still learning these very important lessons.\nTo read more on bosses (good, bad and great), check out my book titled 'Bad Bosses Ruin Lives: The Building Blocks for Being a Great Boss' and go to my website\nhttps://www.badbossesruinlives.com/\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "4 differences between incentives and recognition\nDebra Corey\nJul 23, 2024\n3 min read\nI walked into my MD’s office, prepared and ready to discuss a recognition program that I wanted to put into place. I got through about two minutes of my presentation and they interrupted me to say - “Isn’t recognition the same as incentives? Why should I spend time and money on recognition if I’m already paying my people incentives?”\nWhen I picked my jaw up off of the floor, surprised to hear this reaction, I calmly explained why they were not the same thing, and why we absolutely positively needed both.\nI shared this story recently in a talk I gave about recognition, so thought I’d share it in this blog along with how I got my MD to change their mind and agree to put in place a recognition program. I hope you never find yourself in this situation. But should you, you may want to refer to this explanation of the four key differences to help you overcome these challenges.\n1. Different expectations\nThe starting point is to explain the differences between the two regarding employee expectations. With incentives, which some people refer to as a carrot-and-stick approach, there are specific expectations. You dangle a carrot on a stick out to people to do something - sell a product, hit a milestone, etc. - and you get a reward in return. By doing this, you’re setting an expectation with your people - e.g., when I do x, I will receive a reward.\nOn the other hand, there are no real expectations when it comes to recognition as there is no carrot and stick. Yes, employees know that if they do a good job, they may be recognized, but it’s not expected - e.g. I do x, and I may or may not receive a reward.\n2. Different motivations\nAnother difference concerns the motivations behind each. For example, how will they motivate my people to perform? For incentives, the motivation is extrinsic, as what motivates your people to perform is external, the reward.\nThe motivation to perform when it comes to recognition is very different, this time intrinsic. Employees are not motivated by what they could receive but by their internal motivation and drive to perform and succeed.\n3. Different purposes\nNext, there are differences in the purposes of each and what they ultimately reward. Incentives are used to reward employees for work that is done in a linear, one-dimensional, or straightforward way—e.g., you have a specific goal (carrot) to achieve in a very specific and defined way. Only then will you receive the reward.\nOn the other hand, recognition is used as a way to reward employees for both what\nthey did and how they did it, often not aligned with a specified way to do so. For example, you recognize someone for taking the initiative to come up with a new idea for the company (recognizing the what), you recognize someone for living one of your values by supporting a colleague (recognizing the how), etc. In addition, when recognition is done well, it rewards employees at times when they may not have hit a specific goal. For example, you recognize a salesperson for going above and beyond to try to win a new sale they did not get because of reasons outside of their control. With incentives, this would not happen.\n4. Different timelines\nAnd finally, there are differences in the timelines and impacts associated with each. For incentives, as Daniel Pink says in his fantastic book\nDrive\n:\nIncentives “can deliver a short-term boost - just as a jolt of caffeine can keep you cranking for a few more hours. But the effect wears off - and, worse, can reduce a person’s longer-term motivation to continue the project.”\nRecognition often has a more long-term impact due to its nature. When someone recognizes you, you feel seen, valued, and appreciated, and the feeling lasts longer since it touches you in multiple and different ways. With incentives, yes, you feel great, but it’s for one thing: achieving a specific goal.\nHere is a summary of the key differences shared in this blog:\nLet me end by saying that both of these tools and programs can help you motivate and reward your people. The key, the magic, is to use them together in the most meaningful and effective way. All the best, go out there and motivate, appreciate, and reward your people for all the great things they’re doing and achieving!\nPlease\ncontact me\nif you'd like to discuss how you can create innovative and effective reward and recognition programs at your company.\nRecognition",

    "content": "How to see, say and show appreciation!\nDebra Corey\nFeb 17, 2023\n5 min read\nIn my last\nblog\n, I wrote about how to transform managers into champions of employee recognition by helping them understand why it’s important, sharing seven superpowers and five impacts that appreciation can have. But like anything, this can only happen when it's done ‘right,’ when it’s happening in a way that the superpowers are released in your people and the impacts are felt throughout your organisation.\nTo help our busy managers understand how to do this, I’ve come up with a simple and easy to remember recognition mantra, a call to action -\nSee it. Say it. Appreciate it!\nIt’s a phrase they can use over and over again to remind them of the three key steps to take when recognising their people to show and deliver what I call the “appreciation feeling.” Here is a high level summary of the three steps that I share in my book (link to book on Amazon):\n1. See it – Look for recognition moments everywhere and anywhere\nThe first part of the mantra is “See it,” as this is where it all begins. In training classes I often say that we all need to put our recognition “glasses” on, thus looking for and seeking out opportunities to recognize our people. This is absolutely critical, for if you don’t first see the moments, then they will be missed, and the appreciation will never happen. Here are three tips to help your managers do this:\nLook for recognition in everyone\n– It’s important to look in all directions to find moments that are recognition-worthy in all of our people. Challenge yourself to look at all of the work being done by your team and all of your people, not missing moments (and people) that may not be as visible.\nGet others involved\n– Another way to capture recognition moments is to get more people involved, adopting what I call a “crowdsourcing” approach to recognition. This is critical to keep in mind so you don’t miss any of those important recognition moments by having your team work together to see and recognise all of the great work and contributions being made.\nChallenge your people to take ownership\n– And finally, something I always say to my employees, is that they need to take some accountability and ownership over recognition moments. This involves making sure that their manager is aware of their contributions, their recognition-worthy moments. This is especially important in the new hybrid working world, when managers may not always be able to see, and thus recognise, them.\n2. Say it – Take action and make it happen\nThe next part of the mantra is “Say it,” which means to say and do something once you see a moment that deserves to be recognized, taking action. Too often I hear managers say that they’re too busy, that they don’t have the time to do it, but as I always say in response, “Can you risk what happens if you don’t do something?” or “Do you have the time to pick up the pieces if the person isn’t recognized and fails to achieve the goals you’ve set for them, or worse, walks out the door?”\nThere are two components that need to take place in this part of the mantra. Here is a high level summary of them:\nWords\n– The first component has to do with what you say in the words that you use to recognize your people. As I’m sure you’ve seen and felt, words can have a significant impact and power, which is why it’s important to choose them wisely, and get them right.\nIt’s important to not underestimate how difficult it can be for some managers to select the right words, so I always encourage you to take the time to train them on this, giving them the skills to use their words in the most meaningful and effective way.\nActions\n– The second component has to do with what you say through the actions that you take when you recognize someone. Sometimes it is just in words, in your message, and sometimes it is with some kind of reward. And as with words, getting it right is absolutely critical, for the wrong reward can deliver the wrong meaning and thus the wrong outcome.\nIt’s important to remind your managers not to just throw money, gifts or anything else at their employees as a way to reward recognition efforts without care and thought attached to it. When doing this you could end up with what I refer to as the “cringe-worthy disconnect,” and completely negate the positives derived from recognition.\n3. Appreciate it! – Deliver the ultimate appreciation feeling\nThe last part of the mantra is “Appreciate it!” and is about delivering that appreciation feeling. What I mean by this is that throughout the recognition process it’s important to focus on the end result that you are looking to achieve, which is that of well, appreciation. You want to make sure that all of the steps and actions you take get you to the goal you are trying to achieve, which is your employee genuinely feeling appreciated. If that feeling isn’t met at the end of the day, you haven’t met your objectives in delivering the recognition the right way.\nWhen thinking about this feeling of being appreciated, here are four outcomes that you should be striving for from the person who you’re recognizing:\nFeeling valued\n– Feeling valued through recognition helps us feel good about ourselves, reinforcing a positive sense of self-worth. A survey from the American Psychological Association found that employees who feel valued are more likely to report better physical and mental health, as well as higher levels of engagement, satisfaction and motivation, compared to those who do not feel valued by their employers.\nFeeling seen\n– Feeling seen and being noticed by others through recognition makes us feel that we’re important to others. Studies have found that being seen is necessary to feel like we matter and promote mental and emotional wellbeing. Social psychologists Morris Rosenburg and Claire McCullough wrote that feeling noticed is “the most elementary form of mattering.”\nHaving a sense of meaning\n– Being recognized delivers a sense of meaning, showing us that the work we are doing is meaningful and that it’s making a difference. The Austrian psychiatrist and Holocaust survivor, Victor Frankl, said  that as human beings we are motivated by a “will to meaning.”\nFeeling connected\n– And finally, recognition can help us feel connected to one another, strengthening bonds and leading to stronger and more meaningful relationships. Studies have shown that social connection can lower anxiety and depression, help us regulate our emotions, lead to higher self-esteem and empathy, and actually improve our immune systems.\nLet me end by explaining the exclamation mark, which you may have noticed was at the end of the words “Appreciate it!” This was done intentionally to leverage the power of an exclamation point, informally known as a bang or a shriek, which is used in a phrase or sentence to create a strong meaning, emphasis or feeling.\nThis is exactly what you need to encourage your managers to do when they recognize their people, creating that feeling of appreciation that ends with an exclamation point, with that bang! If they think of like this as they recite the mantra to themselves, it will help them move to this outcome, and leverage the positive powers and impacts of recognition.\nI hope you've found this mantra helpful. If you'd like to learn more tips and tools for managers regarding recognition and appreciation, I encourage you to read my book titled \"\nSee it. Say it. Appreciate it!

Even in “reality,” we think of those depicted in movies and television (think Michael Scott from\nThe Office,\nMiranda Priestly from\nThe Devil Wears Prada\n, or Mr. Burns from\nThe Simpsons\n).\nAnd while these stereotypical bad bosses\ndo\nexist, the reality is that many other types and traits exist in the real workplace, far beyond the caricature we see in cartoons or Hollywood. There are many other faces of bad bosses.\nIn our book\nBad Bosses Ruin Lives: The Building Blocks for Being a Great Boss\nwe explore these faces, or what we call the 10 types of bad bosses. We spent a lot of time, as you can imagine, “naming” our bosses. And while there is no right or wrong way to do this, we decided on names that are more descriptive, direct, and constructive, making them safe and approachable so that all bosses will turn to and not away from them.\n“We need to accept the fact that there are bad boss traits in all of us, not just the few. Bad boss traits are not taboo to discuss; rather, we need to understand and embrace them so that we can accept those that apply to us, instead of denying that they exist. And, equip ourselves with new skills so we’re able to tackle our bad boss traits instead of trying to be a great boss using bad boss techniques and approaches.”\nHere is a high level summary for each of the 10 types of bad bosses. As you read through them, it’s important to keep these things in mind:\nIt’s not all or nothing\n, you could have some of the traits that make up a particular bad boss type and therefore you can be categorized under that bad boss type.\nIt’s not either/or\n, you could be more than one type of bad boss. For most of us, we have a mix of the traits of multiple types of bad (and good) bosses. They're not mutually exclusive.\nIt’s not static\n, with us always being the same mix of bad (and good) boss types. We frequently move\nfrom one type of boss to another as situations change at our company, with our people, and even with ourselves.\nThere can be a domino effect\n, with one bad boss type or trait causing another trait to emerge.\nEven great bosses will have bad boss traits sometimes\n!\nThe Avoider\ndoesn’t show up for their people; ghosts them; doesn’t give them the time, attention and feedback they need to do their job and feel valued.\nThe Ignorer\ndoesn’t listen to what their people say; ignores input, ideas and perspectives and misses out on what they have to say, making them feel undervalued\nThe Hoarder\nwithholds and keeps information to themselves or shares it in ways that don’t fully meet the needs of their people.\nThe Unappreciater\ndoesn’t show their people recognition, gratitude or appreciation, making them feel unvalued, invisible and unappreciated for their actions and contributions.\nThe Pretender\nwithholds the truth and any discomfort it could cause others in an attempt to please and be nice to them; gives answers they feel are wanted and fails to give them the honesty they need and deserve.\nThe Blocker\nprevents or gets in the way of their people’s development and career progression, blocking them from achieving their goals, mastering new skills or contributing to the company’s success.\nThe Firefighter\ndeals with situations in a reactive and urgent manner, moving people from fire to fire with no apparent strategy, affecting their ability to plan, learn, grow and achieve more meaningful and long-term achievements.\nThe Micromanager\nis overly involved in their people’s work, constantly controlling and prescribing what and how work is done.\nThe Blamer\nassigns responsibility to others for a fault or wrong, casting blame and refusing to take any accountability themselves.\nThe Coercer\nuses power in order to bully, control and coerce processes and outcomes, expecting strict compliance and offering their people a low degree of autonomy.\nWe encourage you to be open-minded and honest with yourself. Start by thinking, “Is this me?” instead of putting up your defenses and thinking, “Nah, it couldn’t possibly be me.” Think of it as an\nopportunity\n, and not a punishment. Embrace, and don’t ignore these bad boss traits, for that will take you one step closer to being a great boss.\nIf you’d like to learn more about your boss traits, good, bad and great, you can take our free online assessment test by click on this\nlink\n.\nLeadership",

    "content": "How we’re doing more than pressing the reset button\nDebra Corey\nApr 1, 2020\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nDec 19, 2020\nDoes this sound familiar? You have a problem with your technology that you can’t fix, so you call an expert who 9 times out of 10 tells you to reset your device by turning it off and then turning it back on again.\nIf only it was that easy when it comes to resetting how we go about working in this new and challenging world we’re all living in!\nBut for many, that’s exactly what we’re doing – turning the old way off, turning the new way on, and expecting the reset functionality to magically work.\nBut unlike technology, if we are ever going to work together and run our businesses in this new world, we need to take a step back and not reset by rebooting, but do so by readjusting, modifying and changing what and how we do things.\nIn Josh Bersin’s article titled ‘\nThe Big Reset: Making Sense Of The Coronavirus Crisis\n’, he explains that resetting means looking at new tools, rules and norms, which is exactly what we need to do if we are ever going to make things work.\nI like to describe this resetting process as similar to looking through a different lens (often I have people put on 3D glasses to make the point). And although it may be a bit scary and uncomfortable at first, it’s the only way we can see things differently to create a plan and path by which to get things to work.\nWe need to put on these ‘new glasses’, and question, challenge and see things differently so that they’ll work on a robust and ongoing basis.\nTo illustrate this, let’s use the obvious example, working from home. Now I’m not going to get into the details of how to work from home, I’ll leave that for the experts, but let me just say that when it comes to this important new way of work, the worst thing we can do is to merely reboot and think that people will magically have the skills to work from home. And it’s not just our people, but our processes. We need to take a step back and explore everything we do to communicate and collaborate, looking at them differently by questioning and challenging each and adjusting, refining or even tossing parts away to make it all work and fit together.\nHere are just a few questions you may want to explore:\nHow will we update each other and share information?\n– e.g. if you had monthly face-to-face update meetings before, does the format and timings need to change?\nHow will we ask each other questions or ask each other for help?\n– e.g. how will we create a culture and processes for this to happen when you can’t see each other, and at times, the nonverbal cues?For example, I was on a Zoom call the other day with over 30 people on it, and got more and more frustrated as it was impossible to get a word in. We finally all started waving our hands to the leader of the call to let them know we wanted to chime in with a point or question.\nHow will managers lead differently?\n– e.g. do my managers need new skills and additional support to be able to manage a remote workforce, especially one going through such challenging times?\nSo in ending, let me suggest that you embrace the change and put on your new set of glasses and start looking and acting in different ways. I promise you that it’s not going to be easy, and I promise you that you’ll make mistakes.

    "content": "How joining a charity walk reminded me of 5 engagement lessons\nDebra Corey\nJan 4, 2018\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nApr 12\nI’d been on the go all week during my visit to Australia, doing videos and workshops for our new book on employee engagement.  I was looking forward to Sunday, and looking forward to spending a relaxing day in Manly Beach.\nThat was my plan until  . . . I saw over 1,000 people walking to raise money to find a cure for brain cancer.  How could I not join in and engage in the cause and the activity?  So although I didn’t even have sneakers on, only flip flops, I signed up for the 5k walk and quickly rushed to catch up with everyone.\nIt was an amazing experience for a very worthy cause (here’s a\nlink\nto their website if you’d like to donate). It also reminded me of five important engagement lessons I’d like to share with you.\n1. Everyone engages for different reasons\nSince I walked alone, I had the chance to chat with lots of people, hearing their reasons for being on the walk.  Each story was personal, was meaningful, and engaged them individually with the cause and with the walk.  This reminded me that as we engage with our workforce we need to keep these differences in mind, as no two people engage with our company in exactly the same way.\nWe can’t assume that one magic program is going to appeal to our entire workforce – we need to create a variety of programs to meet the engagement needs of each individual.\nBy doing this, we’ll create personal and meaningful connections, ones that motivate our employees to engage today and in the future.\n2. Engagement has ups and downs\nThe terrain of the walk went from easy flats to challenging uphills.  This meant that at times I was happily engaged, and at others, was wondering why in the world I had decided to do this.\nThis reminded me how we have to keep in mind that our employees will have ups and downs with engagement, and, this isn’t bad.  If they have the foundation of engagement, then the downs won’t be bad and won’t last as long, so we should just support them as they ‘make it up the hill’.  Be prepared and be supportive as they make this transition, and get the foundation right from the start, and you’ll ultimately have an engaged workforce throughout the entire journey.\n3. Stories get you to the finish line\nDuring the walk, I heard the most lovely stories.  These motivated me to finish the walk even when I was tired and was getting blisters from my flip-flops. This reminded me that stories can and should be used as a way to engage with our workforce.\nOur employees are the best storytellers, and we need to find ways to weave their wonderful stories into what we do when we recruit, when we induct, and over and over again as we communicate to our workforce.\n4. Things ‘taste better’ when you’re engaged\nThis reminded me how good things ‘taste’ when you’re engaged.  Work is more interesting, more satisfying, the entire work experience is better.  If we can help our employees create this engagement, we are helping them have ‘the’ best work experience ever, which is good for them and good for the company.\n5. Never give up\nAs I mentioned, I wasn’t prepared for the walk as I walked it in flip-flops.  Halfway through I walked by my hotel and for a split second I thought to myself that maybe I should just give up and go home.  At this exact moment someone walked by me with a t-shirt that said “never give up” and then two people back someone else had a t-shirt saying “true”.  It was almost like they were wearing these just for me.\nThis reminded me that we need to give our employees constant signposts throughout their engagement journey.\nGive our employees reasons over and over again as to why they should engage, and continue to engage, with your organization.  Don’t expect them to keep the momentum going without your constant and thoughtful encouragement and reminders.\nI hope these lessons resonate with you and help you as you engage with your workforce in 2018 and beyond.\nOur new book, Build it: A Rebel Playbook for Employee Engagement will be published by Wiley on 23rd February 2018.

    "content": "3 tips for setting your employee communications up for success\nDebra Corey\nJan 12, 2023\n3 min read\nIt doesn’t matter what industry you work in, where you are located in the world, or the type of employees who work for you, communication is at the core of everything we do to achieve our HR and business objectives.\nWithout communication, or more specifically, without effective communication, we risk and impact employee trust, engagement and the actions they take (or don’t take). By doing it effectively, doing it right, employees move up the communications ladder, which in my book titled ‘Effective HR Communication’, I explain as the following give rungs:\nAwareness\n- Become aware of the message -\nnotice it\nUnderstanding\n- Gain knowledge and understand the message -\nget it\nAcceptance\n- Accept the intent of the message -\nbelieve in it\nCommitment\n- Commit emotionally or behaviorally to the message -\nagree to it\nAction\n: Take action requested/required -\ndo it\nSo how do you get it right, how do you communicate effectively in order to move your employees up the communications ladder? Well a lot has to do with how you communicate, but in this blog I’d like to start at the beginning and focus on what you do to set your communications up for success.\nHere are three tips for setting your communications up for success. It’s worth noting that they are probably things that you already know are important, but too often when it comes to communications we ignore or overlook them.\n1. Begin with a goal(s)\n- There’s a quote by American baseball player Yogi Berra that says “If you don’t know where you are going, you might end up someplace else.” This concept of picturing the end when you begin is absolutely critical when communicating with your people, as it does the following three things:\nIt helps you gain agreement\nfrom the start as to what you are trying to achieve.\nIt helps you resolve any issues\nyou may face as you’re developing and delivering your communications as it gives you the focus and structure you need to make decisions and take action.\nIt defines what success looks like\nby helping you know what you want to happen (and not happen) as a result of your communications.\nSo begin by developing your communication goals or objectives. For example, are you communicating to raise awareness on a new policy so that it can be adhered to, are you communicating to have your employees take an action that benefits them and/or the company? Spell these out from the start.\n2. Know your people\n- If you ever want your employees to jump onto your communications ladder, you first need to know them. What does your communication need to do (and not do) so that it will appeal to them, meet their needs, and be delivered in a way that will help them begin their communications journey?\nI’ve learned the hard way that you can and should never assume that you know what’s going to work for them, for trust me, you’ll often get it wrong. Listen to them, look at what’s worked and not worked before, and come up with a strategy and approach that is right for them.\nKeep in mind that If you’re going to interrupt your employee’s day with your communications, you need to make it worthwhile and relevant for them. You need to deliver the WIIFM (what’s in it for me).\nRemember that your audience is ‘cold’, so currently not engaged with your communications and the topic. Ask yourself, what can I do to ‘defrost’ them and make them take notice AND take action?\n3. Develop a plan\n- If you’re like me, you love jumping in, rolling up your sleeves and doing the work. Great, but before we do this, especially when it comes to communications, it’s important to plan for the following six reasons:\nIt forces you to think things through from the start.\nIt helps you work out who will be doing what.\nIt helps you think through what will happen when.\nIt helps you manage costs, if any, throughout the process.\nIt helps you be flexible as things change.\nIt helps you meet your goals.\nSo begin by taking the time to map out your plan by determining what you’ll do, when you’ll do it, and how you’ll do it. And don’t worry, it doesn’t have to be a complicated spreadsheet, although I do love spreadsheets, it can be as simple and straightforward as you make it. The key is to do something!\nIn ending, let me challenge and encourage you to take these three steps and actions BEFORE you start communicating to your people. It may mean that you need to take a bit more time, but it will be worth it in the end as it will set your communications up for success, and ultimately help your people move up the communications ladder. All the best!\nCommunication",

    "content": "6 ways companies are bringing their values 'out to play' during the pandemic\nDebra Corey\nJun 10, 2020\n4 min read\nUpdated:\nJan 6, 2021\nAccording to research I conducted for my latest book, the majority of companies have company values, and many are using them in their hiring, onboarding, recognition and even performance management processes. But what happens in a crisis, a pandemic? Are company values stuffed away in a filing cabinet or are they “brought out to play”, being used in critical business and people decisions and actions?\nThat’s exactly the question I’ve been researching throughout the pandemic - trying to understand how the role of company values has changed and if/how companies are “bringing them out to play”.\nLet me start with the role of values. In the past, companies have relied on them to describe the behaviours expected of their workforce, to help them stand out against their competitors, and to guide decisions and actions to drive the company’s mission and purpose. And whilst this is very much still true, I’ve seen two new roles surface for values throughout the pandemic:\nThe first is that values are being used to help companies pivot and flex as they deal with the many challenges and obstacles both their business and the world around them are facing. I’m seeing values being used to help drive business and people decisions in new and more critical ways, helping them stay on track to deliver on their mission and purpose by living their values in different, and often, innovative ways.\nA great example is when BrewDog, a company known for making beer, pivoted and flexed by making hand sanitiser in their distillery in Aberdeen. Driven by their value of “we believe that business can be a force for good”, they recognised a national shortage and rose to the occasion by manufacturing and distributing Punk Sanitiser to help those in need.\nThe second is that values are being used as a way to give employees certainty and comfort in a time of uncertainty and fear. With many of the controls over work and personal lives being in the hands of COVID-19 and government regulations, it can be a scary and unsettling time, where any form of control can make a huge difference to employees. By having values to guide them, employees can find comfort in knowing that what they are doing has purpose, meaning and direction.\nFor this point, let me share a personal story of how my company values of “opening the door to possibilities” and “creating magic” have given me comfort and control over the past few months. As I started the year with a new book, I had plans of doing talks and workshops around the world to help companies use their values in new ways and to create their own magic. But with COVID-19 this all came to a halt, and I felt disheartened knowing that I would not be able to deliver on this objective. But armed with my values I took back the control, and developed a DIY tool to help companies with their values so that although I couldn’t help them in person, I could still do what I set out to do. Take that COVID-19, I found a way around you, and that gives me certainty and comfort!\nLet me now move onto the “how”, so how are companies bringing their values “out to play” throughout the pandemic? Here are four of the many examples I’ve seen over the past few months. I hope they inspire you as much as they’ve inspired me!\nAt Atlassian, an enterprise software company, they brought out their value of “be the change you seek”, which talks about having the courage and resourcefulness to spark change, by organising an online charity auction. They went out to small businesses that had been affected by the closures around COVID-19 and bought products, experiences and gift cards from them. They then used them as part of an online auction for their employees, with the money from the bids going to charity along with a match from Atlassian.\nAt Missguided, a global fashion retailer, they brought out their values of “love lots” and “win together” in a wellbeing campaign called “Happy Monday”. The way it works is that every Monday their colleagues share positive stories on their online communications portal that will make one another smile, sharing their love and supporting one another. From updates on charity donations to home working ‘pupdates’, their Happy Monday series is bursting with colleague stories to inspire and spread a little happiness.\nAt Reward Gateway, an HR technology company, they brought out their value “we are human”, which talks about understanding that everyone has a career and personal life to juggle, and to use empathy and understanding to connect at a deeply human level, by creating special work from home themed recognition eCards. They were developed so that employees from around the world could recognise one another for contributing to the business and one another in different ways, to help them feel less isolated, and to connect and bring them together despite work locations.\nAt Tony’s Chocoloney, a Dutch confectionery company, they brought out their value “makes you smile”, which talks about looking at the bright side, to keep laughing, and being full of energy to move chocolate mountains, with their special lockdown meal gifts. These gifts include food from local restaurants, thus putting smiles on the faces of not only their employees but the businesses they are supporting. And to make their employees smile even more, the latest gift was delivered personally by a member of their leadership team.\nLet me end with a quote by Maya Angelou which is that “People will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” So get out there and “bring your values out to play”, letting your employees feel them in what you do . . .  in good times and bad!\nThis blog was originally posted on\nHRD Connect\n.\nCompany Values",

    "content": "5 ways to eliminate your appreciation gap\nDebra Corey\nApr 5, 2022\n4 min read\nUpdated:\nJul 27, 2022\nOver the years, employee recognition has moved from a ‘nice to have’ to a ‘have to have,’ with 87 percent of organisations now having some form of recognition programme. This is because they’ve seen or heard of its power. Studies show the positive impact appreciation can have on revenue (two times higher with recognition), employee engagement (14 percent higher with recognition) and employee burnout (43 percent lower with recognition).\nEmployees want to be recognised for their efforts. Over 90 percent say that recognition is important to them, and 37 percent say that it’s more important to them than pay, training or getting a promotion. When asked, 82 percent of employees have said that recognition is a leading factor in helping them improve their performance, with 79 percent using recognition to make them work harder.\nIt doesn’t take a mathematician to see why recognition and appreciation is something businesses need to utilise with their workforce.\nUnfortunately, recognition is under-valued and under-utilised in many businesses today, causing an ‘appreciation gap’. An appreciation gap is the difference between what employees are saying they want (recognition) and what they’re getting.\nAlmost 7 out of 10 employees (66 percent) say they don’t feel recognised by their\nAlmost 7 out of 10 employees (65 percent) say that they haven’t been recognised in the last year.\nThe main reason for the appreciation gap is because many companies use recognition programs that are stuck in the past, grounded in older strategies and methodologies. One survey found that almost nine out of 10 (87 percent) employees feel their recognition program is “stale, outdated, or used as disguised compensation.”\nIn my latest book\nAppreciate it! The Playbook for Employee Recognition,\nI share strategies, tips and examples to help drive new ways of thinking about and designing recognition programs to eliminate or reduce the gap. Here are just five of them to help and inspire you:\n1 – Move to a more inclusive approach to recognition\nOrganizations and HR leaders must ensure that everyone is involved and treated as individuals, helping to drive a sense of belonging through appreciation.\nFor example, HomeServe has 11 categories for their Shining Star Awards. The goal is to give as many employees as possible the opportunity to be recognised. They include ones for each of their company values, plus additional ones such as “HomeServe Hero,” “CEO Choice Award,” “Community Contributor” and “Career Developer.”\n2 – Recognize the small inputs and contributions\nThese smaller contributions can help lead and add up to the ultimate outcome, keeping employees and work on track and in focus.\nAnother way to look at this is that by only recognizing the ultimate outcome, you’re recognizing the outcome and not the process and steps you’ve taken to get to the win. It would be like training for a marathon and not acknowledging all of the steps and individual goals you’ve achieved to get you there.\nBen Davies, a fitness consultant in the UK, breaks it down into “non-scale victories” (NSV) – those small but important inputs, contributions and achievements. For example, that first run, the run you do on a rainy day so that you hit your mile goal for the week, and so on. “If you don’t acknowledge and celebrate these NSVs you lose motivation, focus, and often, give up on the goal entirely,” says Davies.\n3 – Make a shift in how we think of and act on appreciation\nBy changing the mentality around appreciation, we ultimately give recognition the starring role and rewards the supporting one.\nFor example, NAHL Group plc has ‘Teamie of the Month’ recognition plan, which at most companies would come with some type of reward. Instead, the ‘reward’ is the honour of being recognized, which is done during their monthly team calls.\nAnother example relates to their annual awards, with the reward being money to spend on their own development, along with the responsibility of representing their division in their annual employee survey by presenting it to their team and then gathering feedback on specific actions.\n4 – Remove the constraints and guard rails\nWe’ve built into our recognition programs constraints that are no longer needed. We must remove them to give people more freedom and autonomy to give and receive recognition in ways that work for them.\nFor example, Reward Gateway has ‘You Rock’ awards that employees can give to one another at any time. There are no approvals required, with employees having the freedom and autonomy to decide who and when to give them out. This puts the decision-making in their hands, and at the same time, ensures that recognition can be given in the moment, not having to wait for unnecessary approvals.\n5 – Remove the “winner versus loser” mentality\nWe need to remove the “winner versus loser” mentality that is ingrained into so many recognition programmes, using recognition as a motivator and not as a demotivator.\nFor example, Chelsea Football Club has a quarterly ‘Pride of Chelsea’ award. There is no set number of winners, something common in many recognition programmes. Instead, it’s flexible based on the achievements which have been put forward.\n“We didn’t want to force fit it, as this just doesn’t work. We wanted to retain as much flexibility where one quarter we might have a number of really great submissions we want to recognise versus another quarter where there is one stand out winner,” says Sara Matthews, former Director of Human Resources at Chelsea FC.\nLet me end by encouraging you to challenge yourself to see if/how you can move to these approaches and mindsets to ensure you have no appreciation gap at your company. By doing this, your company will reap the benefits and your employees will feel appreciated and be set up and supported to be and do their best work.\nRecognition",

    "content": "4 work (and life) lessons on the anniversary of “Build it”\nDebra Corey\nFeb 23, 2021\n3 min read\nI can’t believe that it’s been three years since my second book, “Build it: The Rebel Playbook for Employee Engagement”, was published. During this time I’ve heard from people around the world about how much the book, the Engagement Bridge model, and the plays (stories) have helped them.\nAnd for this I am grateful, for this is exactly how my co-author Glenn Elliott and I decided to measure the success of the book - not by how many copies were sold, but by how many people we helped.\nSo in the spirit of helping, in this blog I’d like to share with you four things I learned in writing the book about work and life.\n1. Be brave and walk in the door\n\"When one door of happiness closes, another opens, but often we look so long at the closed door that we do not see the one that has been opened for us.\" Helen Keller.\nI’m a firm believer that life is all about taking chances, and bravely walking in and out of doors that are both open and shut. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn’t, but that’s just life.\nHad I not walked into a new and slightly risky door by joining Glenn to write the book, the new chapter of my life would never have begun. In “Rising Strong” Brené Brown says to “walk into your story and own your truth”, and that’s exactly what I did, entirely re-writing my story.\nI encourage you to be brave and walk into doors, both open and shut, and to find the truth and story that is right for you. Trust me, it’s worth it!\n2. Value and invite in differences\nOne of the biggest lessons I learned in writing with Glenn was the power of differences, something that I believe made the book more rebellious and more impactful. Had we not come with different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives the book would have been one dimensional instead of the multi dimensions that came across on the pages.\nIn a world that is talking and focusing on diversity, I think it’s important to understand and embrace this power, inviting and welcoming diversity into everything you do. It pushes, challenges and makes your work and you better than it could ever be on your own.\n3. Old dogs can learn new tricks\nWhen I joined Glenn to write the book, I had been doing traditional HR for over 20 years. This meant that my ‘playbook’ was filled with the kind of strategies and practices that our book was actually trying to remove from the workplace. But through my learning journey in writing the book, my mindset and my ‘playbook’ completely changed, proving that anyone, regardless of age and background, can change if they really want to.\nI share  this with you because too often we make judgements about people based on their age, background, etc., which gets in the way of progress. I’m a firm believer that if you explain the reason and impact of change, and then give people the tools and support to change, change will happen.\nBtw, one of the reasons I share this with you is that before I joined Glenn to write the book, I was interviewing and had a recruiter call to say that a role he'd put me forward for had decided not to interview me because I was “too old to be creative and to do things in this new world of work”. All I can say is . . . . I think I’ve proved them wrong!\n4. Be kind and pay it forward\nMy job title at my company is Chief Pay it Forward Officer, which is actually the title I suggested to Glenn when I was working with him. I felt it described the work that he and I were doing in our writing and speaking, paying it forward by sharing our tips, stories and inspiring others to change, and that's exactly what I’m doing now in my new company.\nI share this tip because I believe that we all have something to pay forward, something to help one another, and some way to make a difference.\nGlenn taught me the power of this as he constantly and generously shared with everyone and anyone, not worrying about whether they were a colleague or even a competitor. I proudly continue on this mission, and hope to make him proud in every action and difference that I make.\nThank you for joining me for my anniversary blog, and I wish you all the best today and tomorrow!\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "4 ways we can (and should) leave our egos at the door\nDebra Corey\nMay 9, 2019\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nDec 19, 2020\nHave you ever left a meeting thinking to yourself – what an absolute waste of time! Why did everyone care more about making themselves look good and driving their own agenda, then what was best for the team and for the company?\nThat’s exactly the conversation I had with a friend the other day. He’d just come from one of his weekly meetings, and was frustrated that they’d not only wasted everyone’s precious time, but they hadn’t been able to move things forward and accomplish what they needed to.\nI shook my head agreeing with him, for I too had been in this situation many times over the years.\nMy response to him was, “Wouldn’t the world be a better place to work if people would leave their egos at the door and just get on with it?” You’ve probably heard this expression of ‘leaving your ego at the door’ before, as much has been written and said about leaders doing this.\nBut let me ask, if leaders are the only ones leaving their egos at the door, won’t there still be a lot of egos in the room? Shouldn’t we do something to ban them all?\nSo with that in mind, here are a few thoughts and actions on how we can, and should, ban egos from the workplace.\n1. It starts with respect.\nA stumbling block I’ve seen time and time again is the lack of genuine and heartfelt respect for one another. No wonder egos enter the room when there’s no respect, for how can we let down our guards and trust people to contribute if we don’t even respect them?\nIf instead we take the time to get to know one another, showcasing what we know and who we are, maybe we’ll see that we don’t have to constantly own each and every situation. And we may be surprised by all that others bring to the table, having skills and experiences that we never knew about.\n2. Understand the reason for the ego.\nWe often assume that the person with the biggest ego in the room is the person who thinks the most of themselves. Well sometimes yes, and sometimes no. Often I’ve seen that it’s just the opposite, for in fact often they lack the confidence, skills or possibly experience to handle a situation in a more effective way, so their ego comes out as a defence mechanism.\nIf we take the time to again find out more about each other, strengths and weaknesses, we can better support each other. For example, by knowing that a member of the team may feel a bit out of their depth when it comes to financials, you can jump in and help them before their ego comes out and bulldozes and derails the conversation.\n3. Focus on the greater good.\nI once had a boss who told me to pick my battles, fighting only those that would add value to the greater good of the team and the company. I think of him, and this often, using this as my filter before presenting an opinion or a challenge.\nIf we could work with our teams to understand the need for filters, and then work with them to create them, there would be no need to bring out egos.\nAnother great filter to use when deciding what to say (and not say) comes from a the tv show ‘Tidying Up’, which is asking yourself, “does it bring you joy?.\nEither way, filters will help teams understand the difference between helping or hurting the team, and then do something about it.\n4. Be clear on roles.\nThe final problem I wanted to highlight as a cause for egos, is a lack of clarity when it comes to roles. If team members don’t know who owns what, no wonder they (and their egos) jump in time and time again. Think of it this way, say you’re on a basketball team and you don’t assign positions. What happens? You all go for the hoop to score, and no one is left defending your goal. Not a great result for the team!\nIf, instead, you can discuss and outline who owns what, you’ll be clearer on responsibilities, and hopefully egos will realize that there is no need to come out and cause any harm.\nSo in ending, let’s all remember that as the expression goes “there’s no I in team”, and just leave our egos at the door. Would the world of work be a much better (and happier) place to be, absolutely!\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "The Tale of Two Bosses: From Debra to Debby\nDebra Corey\nSep 20, 2024\n4 min read\nUpdated:\nApr 12\nIn this blog I'll be sharing a very personal and embarrassing story of when I went from Debra to Debby, or what I like to describe as the tale of two bosses. Here goes . . . . .\nWhen I was a new boss I found it very challenging to deal with stressful situations. Whether it be a tight or unreasonable deadline, too many conflicting priorities, or a difficult customer. Things would and did throw me into a stress spin (I know that’s not a real phrase, but let’s go with it). The result was that my alter ego, who when I was a child my friends and family called 'Debby', magically appeared! Let me introduce you to her. She was impatient, short and sharp with her people, and often extremely demanding. Not at all like Debra, my other personality.\nThe result of this was that I turned into a bad boss. In fact, multiple types of bad bosses. This not only made it difficult for my people, but it also made it confusing as they weren’t sure when Debby would emerge. Looking back, I would put her into these bad boss types which come from the 10 types we explore in our\nbook\n:\nAvoider\n- Most of the time, Debby would hide away, which is what an Avoider boss does, only coming out to shout orders or lean over someone to try to get them to finish something quicker. This meant she wasn’t actually there for her people when they needed her, giving them support at the right time and in the right way.\nIgnorer\n- She was also an Ignorer, ignoring what her people had to say and contribute as she was too focused on her stress and on what she felt needed to be done and happen. This meant she missed out on what her people said, did and needed from her.\nHoarder\n- Thinking back, she was also a Hoarder as she was either hiding away or rushing from one thing to another, not spending the time sharing the information, feedback, etc. that her people needed from her.\nCoercer\n- And she was absolutely a Coercer. She’d pop in and out, using power to get things done, often intimidating the people who she actually genuinely cared about and for.\nSolutions\nDoes this sound familiar? I wouldn’t be surprised if it did since, for many of us, we let stress consume us, drawing out our alter egos. To help in these situations, let us share with you some solutions and some ways to overcome these bad boss traits using building blocks from our Great Boss Building Block Model™:\nAuthenticity & Vulnerability\n- The starting point is the use of the Authenticity and Vulnerability building blocks, which w\ne describe as things you “wear” to show your all-important true self. In situations like the one described, we too often hide the stress from our people, not wanting to show (and wear) it for fear that doing so will make us look weak and not worthy of their trust and respect. Rubbish! From our experience, your people will be more likely than not to understand and relate with you when you show and don’t hide these feelings from them, especially when it comes to stress, as it’s something we all have experience dealing with.\nBecause of this, we suggest that in these situations, you come clean with your people. Admit that you’re having these problems and “wear” them so that they’ll understand why and when your alter ego may come out to play when things get too stressful. You may be surprised that they will relate to you, sharing that they have similar problems, or may even have some coping mechanisms that they have successfully used that you can try out yourself. And the added bonus is that when you role model authenticity and vulnerability in this way you show them that it’s ok to wear them, which in the future makes it easier for them and you.\nEmpathy & Compassion\n- Too often when we get stressed we focus solely on ourselves, which stops us from taking the time to be empathetic and compassionate towards our people. As we explain in our book, when it comes to empathy we need to remember that the “door” to it swings both ways, so you don’t just need to be empathetic by opening the door to the feelings of your people, but you need to open the door to your own self-awareness,\nbeing intentionally and consciously aware of how your emotions and behaviors are influencing those around you.\nBut it isn’t enough to just be empathic, you need to take it to the next step by showing compassion and taking action both in the short and long term. For example, in the situation described, the long term solution would be to figure out ways to remove the stress so that Debby never appears. However, since this may take time, there are short term actions that could take place. In fact, after openly explaining my challenges to my people, we agreed that until I got the stress under control, I would hang a sign outside my office door (yes, this happened in the days of bosses having separate offices), one  that said: “Debby is in the office - enter at your own risk.” It was far from perfect, but it was our way of accepting and embracing my bad boss traits as I worked on overcoming them and at the same time, protecting everyone from Debby!\nIn summary, should you face similar challenges remember to:\n“Wear” authenticity and vulnerability, showing your people that you’re not perfect, letting them know that you’re having some challenges.\nShow your people empathy and compassion, considering their needs and not just focusing on your own.\nIf you'd like to have someone come in to speak or run a workshop with your leadership or management team about how to be a great boss, sharing what we call the 3 A's, please contact us, we'd be glad to help.\nLeadership",

    "content": "Build a bridge to employee engagement and . . . . get over it!\nDebra Corey\nJun 12, 2018\n4 min read\nUpdated:\nJul 22, 2023\nHave you ever wondered if there are similarities between bridges and employee engagement? You probably haven’t, but trust me, there are!\nIn fact, the model which is the focus of\nour book\non employee engagement, “Build it: A rebel playbook for employee engagement”, is called ‘The Engagement Bridge™.\nHere are five reasons or similarities between bridges and employee engagement:\nReason 1:  Connection\nLet’s start with connection, for that is the most obvious similarity. What’s the objective of a bridge? Connecting point A to point B, helping us to safely complete our travels. What happens if there is no bridge and no connection? In some situations you may not be able to complete your journey, so make the connection, or in some situations you can, but it will be with increased effort, time, etc.\nIsn’t the same true with engagement? Isn’t the ultimate objective to connect employees to a company, helping them build a solid and lasting connection and relationship? Yes a company can survive without employee engagement and without this connection, but studies have shown they have lower profit and higher levels of turnover.\nReason 2:  Dissipation\nDid you ever wonder how a bridge can stretch over a great distance, and day after day, year after year deal with the forces of nature? The answer is in how it’s designed, specifically how it’s designed to deal with the important forces of compression and tension. In bridge design the best way to deal with these powerful forces is with something called ‘dissipation’, which is spreading out the bridge parts evenly over a greater area so that no one spot bears the concentrated brunt of it all.\nThe same is true with engagement and your engagement bridge. If you build an engagement bridge that has many parts it will be able to withstand the powerful forces from our employees. For example, build a company with open and honest communication and you’ll be able to deal with the ‘winds’ and ‘storms’ from your employees.\nSo like a bridge, if the engagement elements share the brunt of these forces, they can create engagement at each stage, and together they can withstand the test of time.\nReason 3:  Resonance\nResonance is another factor that bridge makers need to deal with, and happens when one object is vibrating at the same natural frequency of a second objective that forces that second object into vibrational mode. Think of it as the vibrational equivalent of a snowball rolling down a hill and becoming an avalanche. When designing a bridge, engineers put in things called ‘dampeners’ to interrupt these waves and prevent them from growing, and basically taking down the bridge.\nWith employee engagement I like to think of culture as our dampeners, for by having a strong and ongoing culture it can strengthen our bridge, helping us prevent a snowball turning into an avalanche. Add in the other engagement bridge elements and your snowballs will end up big enough for a snowball fit but no more.\nReason 4:  Materials\nIn 1444 the Rialto Bridge in Venice, Italy collapsed, sending hundreds of spectators there to watch the wedding of the Marquess of Ferrara’s wedding into the canal and to their death. Why, because the materials the bridge was made of, wood, was not strong enough to handle the weight of the crowd. The lessons learned from this bridge disaster were that stronger, more resilient materials were required to build bridges, and in fact this bridge was rebuilt in stone and still stands today.\nThe same lesson can be made with employee engagement, for when we build our engagement bridge we need to think of what ‘materials’ we use, so how will we design each element to last the test of time?\nGet the materials right and it will not only encourage more ‘passengers’ on your bridge, but it will have more of a lasting effect.\nReason 5:  Break Step\nThis final point has nothing to do with the construction of a bridge (or engagement), but talks about how it is used.  Have you ever wondered why armies do something called ‘break step’ when crossing a bridge? So instead of marching in time, which how armies normally march, they are ordered to break their marching steps when crossing a bridge.\nThe story behind this is from April 1831 when a brigade of soldiers marched in step across England’s Broughton Suspension Bridge. According to the accounts of the time, the bridge broke apart beneath the soldiers, throwing dozens of men into the water. Why? Well they found that when marching in harmony they create rhythmic oscillations, or vibrations, that causes the bridge to collapse, so enter the break step, which is marching to different beats.\nSo what does this have to do with employee engagement?  Shouldn’t we be saying that in order to achieve engagement our employees all need to march across our bridge in unison?\nThe answer is yes and no, yes we want all our employees to ‘cross the bridge’ (engage with our organisation), but the reality is that they will and need to do it in their own ‘stride’. If we build our bridge in a way that it can hold the differences and diversity in our workforces, then we’re allowing engagement with each and every employee. If, on the other hand, we build something that allows only one kind of ‘step’, then our bridge will either not be crossed or it will collapse as we force everyone to walk in perfect harmony.\nIf you’re interested in learning more about the Engagement Bridge™ you can get the first two chapters for free by\nclicking here\n. And with that, I wish you the best in building your own bridges of engagement with your workforce.\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "Feeling the flow of the new ways of working\nDebra Corey\nFeb 1, 2021\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nMay 4, 2023\nHave you ever been asked to describe how the workplace has changed? Well that’s exactly the question I was asked during a recent virtual panel discussion, being asked to describe how the intersection of work and home has changed over the years. The answer that sprang to mind was an analogy where I compared it to gymnastics apparatus. And since my co-presenters seemed to like it, I thought I’d share it with you in this blog.\nAs you read it, I’d encourage you to think about which piece of apparatus\nyour company\nand\nyou personally\nare on now, and which you’d like to be on in the future.\n1. Work-life balance\nWork-life balance is a term that first came into use in the 1970s and 80s as stressed out baby boomers were trying to achieve balance in their lives. It looked at work as one part of an employee's experience, and outside interests such as family, friends, hobbies, etc. as another. It’s endgame was about equilibrium and division of time, making sure that one didn’t take away too\nmuch from the other.\nI compare this to the balance beam, since it’s all about getting the balance right between work and life. But like a beam, getting the balance right can be difficult, for it’s almost impossible to split your time equally since home and work often get in the way, which means you ‘fall off’ one or the other.\nIn a UC Berkeley and Berkeley Haas\npaper\nthey make the point that the traditional image of a scale associated with work-life balance creates a sense of competition between the two elements, evoking a binary opposition between work and life.\n2. Work-life integration\nWork-life integration is the next term that was introduced, and as written in an article in\nForbes\n, “As millennials have risen through the professional ranks they are more interested in finding a career path that will support their 'lifestyle,' which in this context means their life outside of work.\"\nI compare this to the vault, which is where you go on and off of the apparatus as you perform your gymnastics move. Unlike the beam, you intentionally go from one to the another, so there’s more of an integration.\nI believe this term and this concept is much better than the former, as it moves from opposition to synergies between work and life. However, I’m not sure it’s enough, for if I compare it again to the vault, it sometimes is not smooth enough, abruptly moving from one to the other.\n3. Work-life flow: the bars\nThe final term I’d like to share is work-life flow. Now I have to be honest and say that when I used it during the panel discussion I had not actually heard it before. However, in researching for this blog, I’ve come to find that it's a term used by some, and refers to when work and life flow smoothly and continually from one to another, when activities are not limited or restricted by timing or a strict plan.\nI compare this to the bars, which is a lovely apparatus to watch as gymnasts flow gracefully and effortlessly from one bar to the other, twisting and turning as they fly between them.\nThe concept of flow was described in a ResearchGate paper as “the intersection of optimal being and optimal doing.”\nThis concept resonates with me, as it’s where not just where you're in the 'flow' by doing and being your best, but taking it that one step further, it's where work and life can co-exist. It's where they flow gracefully from one to another without friction and competition, doing what’s right for you\nand\nfor your company.\nHowever, like the bars, where the apparatus and techniques have changed over the years to allow this flow, so too does the workplace. We need to change our focus from working hours to a focus on productivity, from rigidity to flexibility, and to encouraging and supporting our employees both inside and outside of the workplace.\nLet me end by saying that the point of this blog is to show how this intersection has changed over the years, but more important, how\nthere is still more work to be done to evolve and change it in the future\n. I encourage you to take the time to understand and map out what will drive and support your business and your people to get this intersection right, changing your processes, tools and even mindsets to support it. For this is where you’ll see the magic happen, and, going back to my gymnastics analogy,\nthis is where you and your people will achieve the perfect 10!\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "When life hands you lemons, write a book!\nDebra Corey\nMar 3, 2017\n4 min read\nUpdated:\nDec 19, 2020\nI’m writing this on my big day, the day my very first book launched. I should have been filled with excitement and pride, which I was, but I was also filled with an unexpected surge of emotion.  It all of a sudden hit me – I had taken the lemons which life had handed me and….I’d written a book!  And not only a book, but a book that is going to help others in my profession, and a book that has directly led to me landing an amazing job in an amazing company.  How’s that for lemonade!\nLet me start from the beginning, which was a year and a few months ago.  I’d gone into work after the holiday season to be told that I was being made redundant (for non-UK readers this means that my company had decided they no longer needed my job . . . or me!).  I’ve had this happen to me before, having been in the workplace for over 30 years, but this was made even worse by the fact that I had just picked up and moved my family, and we were in the middle of selling our old house and buying a new one. More lemons and more stress!\nNeedless to say, I came home shocked and scared, wondering how I was going to keep up a brave front for my children, and get through not only finding a new job but sorting out the challenges we were having buying and selling homes (which in the UK is not very straightforward!).  Very early on in the process, my husband and I decided that we were going to handle both of these in the ‘right’ way – I was going to find not just any job but the ‘right’ job, and  we weren’t going to settle on any house, but the ‘right’ house for our kids and us. Good decisions, but more lemons!\nI began by taking charge of my lemons, putting on my determined and optimistic persona.  This is when I came up with the idea of a book, deciding that it would be the perfect way to occupy my time, my mind, and my energies….doing something constructive with my lemons!  I had never written a book before, and in fact it wasn’t something that had been high on my bucket list.  It just hit me one day, I had something that I passionately wanted to write about, communications, and this was the perfect time to give it a go. Now I’m not  saying it was easy, and using the lemon/lemonade analogy, I probably didn’t have the proper ‘tools’ to make lemonade, but hey, I did it and it ended up being something that I am extremely proud of and as I mentioned at the start, will help others.\nLet me jump now to the other happy ending to my story, and that is about me finding the ‘right’ job. I had almost finished my book, and was asked to speak at a seminar about the model I created and explained in the book. I showed up, did my presentation and then sat back to listen to the next speaker, Glenn Elliott (CEO and Founder of Reward Gateway).  What can I say about Glenn, he and his story was so inspirational that I asked him if I could interview him for the book.  We met up for the interview, I got my fantastic story for the book, and then Glenn completely surprised me and offered me a role he decided to create after hearing me speak.  I knew immediately it was the ‘right’ job for me, especially as I had walked away from others that didn’t sound or feel right.  This was an even better happy ending than I could have ever imagined.\nSo what did this teach me and what do I want to share with you?\nThe first lesson was about the lemons – specifically their purpose.  I learned that lemons don’t have to be something bad if you use them to create the right ‘recipe’.  Avoid them and/or let them overpower you, and you end up with a bunch of useless ingredients or even worse rotten lemons surrounded by green mould!  We need to take the time to understand them, and like ingredients in a recipe, understand if/where they fit in, and how they should be used.\nThe next lesson is about the ‘recipe’ itself – what you decide to do with the lemons.  For me, it was writing a book, as I thought it would give me purpose and outcome which I’d be proud of. For you it may be different, but the point is, don’t start doing anything with the lemons until you decide what the recipe is going to be.\nThe final point is one that works alongside the others, and that is to have belief and trust in yourself.  Believe that you can handle the lemons, and you can create a recipe which is right for you.  As Arianna Huffington suggests in her book “Thrive”, you need to ‘evict you obnoxious roommate’, those negative thoughts that make you think you can’t do things.  I had never written a book before, but that didn’t stop me (or my publisher) from believing in me, which is why I strongly believe that I’ve been able to achieve my happy ending.\nIn closing, my wish for you is that if you find yourself in a situation where you are handed lemons …..you find your own way to use them to create your own happy ending!\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "Three tips for creating meaningful recognition\nDebra Corey\nJul 21, 2022\n6 min read\nUpdated:\nMay 4, 2023\nOver the years, companies have come to understand the importance and power of employee recognition – to our people and to our companies.\nLet’s start with a piece of data from a study that asked employees what matters most to them, and what is the most important thing your manager or company currently does that would cause you to produce great work. The clear winner was appreciation, with 37% of respondents saying “recognize me,” which was higher than getting more pay (7%), getting more training (6%) or getting a promotion (4%), showing how appreciation matters the most to them.\nThe study also shows that appreciation and recognition matter to our companies, for when answering the question of what matters most to them, respondents also said that by getting more recognition, they’d produce great work.\nHowever, the only way a company will achieve these results is when they get recognition “right.” A critical factor in doing this is by making recognition meaningful – delivering meaning in three ways – in what you recognize, what you say, and what you do. By doing this, you show the person that you have seen, value and appreciate their specific contributions.\n1. Create meaning in what you recognize\nAs we all know, what gets recognized gets repeated, as it sends messages to our people that these actions and behaviours are the ones that the company considers important. And for this reason, we need to recognize not just any actions and behaviors, but the “right” ones, ones that will help your business achieve your goals and objectives. Think of it like a dart board, with the bullseye in the middle representing what you’re asking your employees to “aim” for in what they do.\nThe most effective way to create meaning in what you recognize is by recognizing your people against your company values. As I talk about in my book ‘\nBringing Your Values Out to Play\n,’ this does 3 things:\nIt creates focus – showing your employees what they need to aim for.\nYou signal that values are important – putting them front and centre, and not hidden away in an employee handbook or on a poster hanging in the office.\nYou create habits by recognising against them.\nRecognizing your people against your company values is like a live classroom experience, teaching and demonstrating what your values mean and how they look in real-time, and in the moment.\n2. Create meaning with recognition messages\nAnother key element of making recognition meaningful is in what I call the \"say,\" which are your recognition messages. Saying ‘thanks for your help,’ although very nice, does little to make the person feel recognized since there’s likely little to no understanding of what they’ve done to merit that recognition. And going back to the previous point, this vague and meaningless message does little to help the person know what they did right, and thus what they should continue doing.\nIf instead, the message says, ‘Thanks for coming in early to prepare and distribute materials to the team to help them understand how the new office scheduling system will work,’ the person knows specifically what they’ve done, and how they’ve helped you and others. Since this doesn’t always come naturally to people, whenever I run a recognition training session with managers and employees, I share this simple 3-step process that comes from Gregg Lederman’s book titled ‘\nCrave\n’:\nStep 1: Tell the Action\n: Specifically describe what the person did, their behaviour or action, that is worthy of being recognized.\nStep 2: Connect to a Value\n: Next, link the behaviour or action to your company values or specific company objectives, as explained in the previous tip.\nStep 3: Share the Impact\n: Last, but certainly not least, it’s important to show the benefit and impact of the behaviour or action that you are recognizing.  As Lederman says, “By sharing the impact, you are providing another healthy dose of respect and purpose!”\nBy creating meaningful recognition messages, you multiply the impact of the appreciation, taking it to an entirely new level.\n3. Create meaning with recognition rewards\nJust as important as the \"say\" is the \"do,\" creating meaning by what you do to recognize your people through your recognition rewards. Sometimes it’s non-financial, with the messages being the reward, and other times it’s financial, with some token being given to recognize your people for their achievements and contributions.\nWhen it comes to selecting the most meaningful reward it’s important to keep these 2 things in mind:\nConsider the connection between the reward and the contribution, making sure that they’re aligned (e.g. if it is a small contribution the reward should be small, if it was a larger contribution, the reward should be larger).\nConsider differences in your workforce when determining rewards to meet their diverse set of needs (e.g. how do they like to be recognised, what will make them genuinely feel appreciated?).\nTo tick the box for both of these points, more companies are rewarding employees with points to spend through their recognition platform. By doing this, you can award the right amount based on the contribution made, and give the employee the choice as to which reward they’d like.\nOne of my favourite stories shared with me by an employee at a former company was when he said he saved up his points to buy a pair of shoes. And each time he wore them, he thought of all of the people that had recognized him, making the appreciation feeling happen over and over again!\nAnother way to create meaningful rewards is to do something unique to your business and/or culture. Here are 8 examples from my book titled ‘\nAppreciate it! The Playbook for Employee Recognition\n’:\nAt\nCharles Tyrwhitt\n, a British retailer, they have a Tick from Nick Award which is given to employees doing work relating to the CSR agenda as well as charitable work. Winners receive a special gift related to their work such as a free ticket to The Prince’s Trust award finals for charity-related work.\nAt\nHeineken\n, one of the world’s largest brewers, they have an Inspiring People Awards (IPA Award which is given to employees who go above and beyond. For the awards they offer choice, from money to spend on their recognition platform, to a day off work, or a dinner at one of their pubs.\nAt\nHomeServe\n, one of the U.K.’s leading home assistance providers, they have a quarterly Shining Star Award which is given to employees for going above and beyond when it comes to the customer, environment, colleagues or the business. Winners receive a cash award as well as a “money can’t buy” experience such as a coaching from a member of the executive team, the ability to attend a meeting with an executive, or even a ride to work in a limousine or the Chief Exec’s helicopter.\nAt\nInterGlobe Aviation Limited\n(IndiGo), India’s largest passenger airline, they have an Employee of the Quarter Award that is given to employees who rise to the occasion and go beyond the call of duty to ensure the safety and wellbeing of IndiGo and its customers. Winners receive a badge for their lanyard as well as points to be spent on their recognition platform. In addition, a photograph of them is displayed on one of their aircrafts, with their family being invited for the unveiling, creating a great moment of pride for the employee, their family and their colleagues.\nAt\nNAHL Group plc\n(NAHL), the parent company of National Accident Law, they have an annual award where employees can nominate one another for awards such as values champions, employee’s choice award, team of year, manager of the year, etc. Team and manager of the year winners receive a night out together as a team, and the employee’s choice winner receives a weekend away. Values champion winners receive money to spend on their own development, along with the responsibility of representing their division in their annual employee survey by presenting it to their team and then gathering feedback on specific actions.\nAt\nNextLevel Internet\n(NextLevel), a U.S. cloud-based voice, internet and unified communication service provider, they have their Night on the Town Awards that are given for going above and beyond. Winners receive a crisp $100 bill that they can use to go out on the town and celebrate with their family and friends. This is the only financial award they give, and when asked they explained that it’s not really about the money, as it’s about the experience of a celebratory moment.\nAt\nZappos\n, a U.S. retailer, they have their monthly GOAT Awards that are given to members of their customer loyalty team who have gone above and beyond. Winners receive money to spend on their recognition platform as well as a life-size toy goat.\nAt\nZoom\n, a videoconferencing platform, they have a quarterly executive nominated award to recognise individuals and teams outside of their own group based on going above and beyond their Zoom abilities. Winners receive a meal for themselves and their families as they believe that the family should be a part of the recognition as they’ve contributed to the achievement.\nAs you design and re-design your recognition programmes, keep in mind this concept and goal of being meaningful. Making them meaningful in what you recognize, what you and your people ‘say’ in their recognition messages, and what you ‘do’ through your recognition rewards. By achieving this, you can embrace and leverage the power of recognition, reaping all of the benefits that they can and do deliver. All the best!\nRecognition",

    "content": "5 questions to ask to create survey ‘happy endings’\nDebra Corey\nNov 9, 2018\n4 min read\nUpdated:\nMar 15, 2021\nOnce upon time there was a prince. He was handsome, and he was well-loved by his followers. But then a curse turned him into a hideous beast, punishing him for his cold-hearted and selfish ways. Soon his followers came to both fear and mistrust him.\nSound familiar? It should, as it’s from ‘Beauty and the Beast’, a fairy tale we all know and love. It should also sound familiar as its exactly what’s happened when it comes to employee engagement surveys. We used to love them, but over the years many of us have fallen out of love with them, fearing and dreading them as they’ve become more and more ‘beast-like’.\nThis was exactly the conversation I had the other day during an engagement workshop, chatting with HR colleagues about their engagement challenges. Time and time again they raised the point about how ineffective engagement surveys had become over the years, with them using the word ‘beast’ more than once.\nAnd I’m not surprised, for many companies continue to do employee engagement surveys for the wrong reasons and in the wrong ways.\nHere are five key questions to consider before doing your next survey:\n1 – Why?\nThe starting point should always be by asking the question ‘why’ – why are you asking for employee feedback and doing an engagement survey in the first place? We often jump in believing that the ‘why’ is to have an engagement score to dangle in the faces of our leadership teams to show the great work we’re doing or to achieve an award or industry ranking. These are good reasons, but should never be the primary ‘why’.\nThe real ‘why’ should be to help you make strategic decisions that are right for your business and for your workforce. So start by really dissecting the ‘why’ and dig deep to understand exactly why you’re asking, which in turn will help you answer the other questions.\n2 – What?\nThe next question to ask is ‘what’ – what feedback are you trying to obtain based on the why? Structure your survey questions around these so that you target exactly what you need to understand better.\nFor example, if your ‘why’ is to understand why employees are saying they aren’t feeling appreciated, then ask questions to dig deeper into why they feel this way. Questions may be: Do you feel recognized for the job you’re performing? Are you receiving recognition on a timely basis? Does your manager recognize you for your contributions? What could we do to make you feel more appreciated?\n3 – How?\nThe next question to ask is ‘how’, how are you going to get feedback from your employees? For this question I have a few suggestions:\nDon’t rely on one source\n. Surveys are a great way to capture feedback, but I’d suggest that you find other ways, whether formal or informal to supplement this.  This could be by quick pulse surveys, informal feedback sessions, or even adding opportunities to share feedback when company news and information is shared.\nIn my book \"\nBuild it\n\", I share the story of HSBC's \"shut up and listen\" program, a forum they created to help employees share their thoughts and views freely, encouraging and creating an environment where employees can not only speak up but feel it's their responsibility to do so. This is a great example of creating a way for your employees to truly speak up, benefiting both employees and the company.\nPartner with managers\n. Managers are a key source of feedback as they hear things from their employees that you may not have access to. Reach out to them and create an open dialogue so they’ll share feedback with you on a timely basis. Managers are also key to encouraging their teams to participate in providing feedback, so use them and all of their powers.\nCommunicate it effectively\n. If you want feedback you need to communicate to your workforce in an effective way, letting them know why you’re asking and what you’ll be doing with their input. Do this at the beginning and throughout the process so they feel partnered with and appreciated for their input.\n4 – Who?\nThe next question is to ask who – who is going to be responsible for actioning the feedback? In the past it was solely owned by HR, which I believe is a key contributor to them turning into beasts. There needs to be shared ownership between HR and business leaders of the feedback, with everyone working together to drive strategic change.\nIn my book \"\nBuild it\n\", I share the story of how Dunelm, a home furnishing chain in the UK, created their \"always on\" survey that has become a useful management tool, with managers being able to see and act on feedback immediately, helping them make better decisions for their stores day in and day out. This is a great example of having managers take responsibility and accountability for owning and acting on employee feedback.\n5 – When?\nThe final question is determine the ‘when’, so when should the feedback be asked for? Normally done first, I suggest it be the last question, as you can’t decide this until you answer the other questions.\nIs there a magic number for how often surveys and feedback should be asked for? I’d love to say yes, as it would make our lives easier, but the answer is no. And the reason is that it depends on how you answer the other questions.\nTo me the key is that it should be ‘just-in-time’. What I mean by this is that you should only ask for feedback when a) you need it and b) you’re prepared to act on it. The most frustrating thing for an employee is to be asked for feedback and then nothing happens with it. They won’t feel appreciated, valued, and next time you ask, they’ll ignore you.\nI hope this will help you turn your engagement survey ‘beasts’ into ‘princes’, and create the ‘happy ending’ and employee engagement at your company.\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "4 tips for building DEI into your recognition programs\nDebra Corey\nJun 13, 2023\n4 min read\nUpdated:\nJun 16, 2023\nLet’s start with the good news, which is that we’re finally in a place where the majority of companies have a strategy that addresses diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). Companies are also investing in programs to drive awareness and change in this important area. Great, but let me ask you a question -\nwhat are you doing to build DEI into your recognition strategy and programs?\nDo your recognition programs apply and work effectively across your entire diverse workforce? Or, do they create a divide or wedge between it, with the “haves” and “have nots”, those being recognized and those feeling under-appreciated, unnoticed, demotivated and disengaged?\nRecognition is an absolutely critical, and yet often ignored, area to address DEI. And to help you with this, let me share four tips that I write about in my books and use when working with clients.\n1. Look for recognition everywhere in everyone\nOne of the biggest reasons that recognition does not drive and support DEI is that important recognition moments are being missed. Great things are happening all around us that deserve to be recognized, but we’re missing them because we’re not looking for them\neverywhere\nand we’re not looking for them in\neveryone\n.\nTo illustrate, let me take you to an all-employee meeting I attended where they announced the winners of the quarterly recognition awards. As they called out the names, I could hear people whispering to each other, “Oh it’s them again, the only people who are ever recognized are the ones working in sales and customer service. What about everyone else? Don’t they know that these people are only successful because of us?”\nThis happens way too often as companies don’t have a mindset and practice to look for opportunities to recognize in everyone. I’m almost certain that if you look closely, looking in “all directions” as I say, then you will find actions and behaviors that deserve to be recognized. If you’d like to read more on how to do this, check out this\nblog\nwhere I share eight places to look for recognition moments.\n“All employees deserve to be recognized, to feel appreciated, regardless of their job, department, manager, and anything else that makes them who they are and what they do.”\n2. Remove limits in who can give recognition\nThe next tip moves from what is being recognized to who can and should recognize. Ask yourself, “am I being inclusive in who I allow to give it?” When companies limit it to just managers a few things can happen. First, it creates a “them” and “us” situation as employees miss out on the opportunity of giving recognition, which has been proven to be just as important as receiving recognition. And second, it limits the number of recognition moments that are given as it reduces the number of people involved, which can directly or indirectly lead to feelings of exclusion.\nFor this reason, more and more companies have adopted a peer-to-peer approach to recognition, or what I call a “crowdsourcing” approach, as it encourages your people to work together to create and have collective responsibility for recognition.\n“Crowdsourcing recognition means that you have eyes, ears and hearts looking for and capturing recognition moments.”\n3. Remove limits in who can receive recognition\nNext, and still addressing the who, has to do with who can and should receive recognition. At many companies there are limits that are put in place, e.g. only one person can win employee of the month, or only six people can win employee of the year, etc. This can lead to others feeling excluded, creating what I mentioned earlier with the “haves” and “have nots,” closing the door on recognition for many of your hard-working employees.\nFor this reason, I encourage companies to challenge traditional ways and thinking when designing their recognition programs. Here are two examples of companies doing this from my book (Appreciate it! The Playbook for Employee Recognition):\nAt Chelsea Football Club, they have no set number of winners for their quarterly “Pride of Chelsea Awards”, being flexible based on the achievements of those being nominated.\nAt HomeServe, for their quarterly “Shining Star Awards” they have 11 categories to cover a wide range of situations and people, giving more people the opportunity to be recognized. These include six that represent their values plus additional ones such as ‘HomeServe Hero,’ ‘CEO Choice award,’ ‘Community Contributor’ and ‘Career Developer.’\n“We need to practice ‘equal opportunity’ recognition, looking at recognition through an inclusion lens, making sure that everyone has an equal opportunity to be noticed, appreciated and recognized.”\n4. Remove hurdles and barriers that prevent participation\nAnd finally, for recognition to truly be inclusive it needs to have the opportunity to be used in a consistent way. Far too often we put up hurdles or barriers that prevent some of our people from participating and engaging with recognition. If recognition is to be fair and inclusive, these barriers must be removed, so that everyone can use recognition in the way in which it was intended.\nAn example from my book of a company removing barriers is Burton’s Biscuit Company, who go out of their way to make sure bakery employees don't miss out on recognition since the majority don’t have access to a company phone or laptop. One way they do this is by having a live feed of the recognition awards from the social recognition wall to the T.V.s located across the bakeries so they can be a part of recognition even while baking cookies. This not only gives them the opportunity to celebrate recognition moments, but it encourages them to recognise one another.\nAnother example is Atlantis Resorts Dubai, who go out of their way to give all of their employees an equal chance when it comes to nominating one another for recognition awards. With 87 different nationalities, for many of their employees English is not their first language. So for every nomination that is received for recognition awards, the HR team ‘beautifies’ them, making sure that they all read well and thus all have equal chances for being selected as a winner.\nLet me end by encouraging you to put on your DEI lens as you look at your existing recognition program, making sure that you have one that aligns with all of the other great work you are doing to create an inclusive culture and workplace.\nIf you’d like to discuss how to design and deliver a recognition strategy and program that looks through a DEI lens, please\ncontact me\n, I’d love to help you achieve this important objective.\nRecognition",

    "content": "The 4 \"golden rules\" of recognition\nDebra Corey\nJul 8, 2022\n6 min read\nMany societies and cultures have in place some version of what they call ‘The Golden Rules,’ which is a philosophy and way of treating one another. Some have five, others seven or even ten, but what they have in common is that they’re all centred around acting with care, compassion and respect.\nIn my latest book, ‘\nAppreciate it! The Playbook for Employee Recognition\n,’ I’ve shared my version of ‘The Golden Rules,’ which are four guiding philosophies and principles I’ve used over the years to design or redesign recognition programs. They too focus on concepts such as care, compassion and respect as they relate to employee recognition, using them to drive and deliver genuine and meaningful appreciation to and between our people.\nThese four rules form the acronym ‘MUST,’ with each letter standing for a key point. Together, they create a call to action, what we ‘must’ do to achieve our recognition objectives. Here is a high level overview for each of these rules:\nM – Make recognition meaningful\nLet’s start with the letter ‘M,’ which stands for making employee recognition meaningful. This is critical so that the recipient truly feels recognized, and it happens when you deliver meaning in both what you\nsay\nand what you\ndo\n, showing the person that you have seen, value and appreciate their specific contributions. Here are three tips to help you achieve this:\nGet recognition messages right\nThe ‘say,’ which are your recognition messages, is absolutely critical to the success of a recognition moment. Saying ‘thanks for your help,’ although very nice, does little to make the person feel recognised since there’s likely little to no understanding of what they’ve done to merit that recognition. If instead, the message says, ‘Thanks for coming in early to prepare and distribute materials to the team to help them understand how the new office scheduling system will work,’ the person knows specifically what they’ve done, and how they’ve helped you and others.\nBy creating meaningful recognition messages, you multiply the impact of the appreciation, taking it to an entirely new level.\nGet recognition rewards right\nJust as important as the ‘say’ is the ‘do,’ creating meaning by what you do to recognize your people through your recognition rewards. Sometimes it’s non-financial, with the messages being the reward, and other times it’s financial, with some token being given to recognise your people for their achievements and contributions.\nWhen it comes to selecting the most meaningful reward it’s important to keep these two things in mind:\n(1) Consider the connection between the reward and the contribution, making sure that they’re aligned (e.g. if it is small contribution the reward should be small, if it was a larger contribution, the reward should be larger).\n(2) Consider differences in your workforce when determining rewards to meet their diverse set of needs.\nCreate meaning in what you recognize\nMoving onto the ‘dot’s important to recognize the actions and behaviors that not only help your employees feel appreciated, but help your business achieve their objectives and success. If you don’t do this, then quite frankly you’re flushing the time and money you spend on recognition down the drain.\nThe most effective way to do this is by recognizing your employees against your company values. As I talk about in my book\n‘Bringing Your Values Out to Play,’\nthis does three things: (1) It creates focus - like a dartboard, showing your employees the target they're shooting for.\n(2) You signal that values are important – putting them front and centre, and not hidden away in an employee handbook or on a poster hanging in the office.\n(3) You create habits by recognizing against them.\nRecognizing your people against your company values is like a live classroom experience, teaching and demonstrating what your values mean and how they look in real-time, and in the moment.\nU – Make recognition unified\nThe next golden rule focuses on designing recognition programs that are unified and inclusive. It’s important that recognition does not create a divide or wedge between your workforce, with the ‘haves’ and 'have nots' based on location, department, manager or function, to name a few.\nInstead, recognition needs to be universal, making it available for all to give and all to receive, thus increasing your chances of creating a recognition culture and achieving your recognition objectives. Here are two tips to help you achieve this:\nCreate a crowdsourcing approach to giving recognition\nThe first part of being unified and inclusive has to do with who you allow to\ngive recognition\nthrough the design of your programs. When companies limit it to just managers a few things can happen. First, it creates a ‘them’ and ‘us’ situation as employees miss out on the opportunity of giving recognition, which has been proven to be just as important as receiving recognition. And second, it limits the number of recognition moments that are given as it reduces the number of people involved, which can directly or indirectly lead to feelings of exclusion.\nFor this reason, more and more companies have adopted a peer-to-peer approach to recognition, or what I like to think of as a ‘crowdsourcing’ approach, as it encourages your people to work together to create and have collective responsibility for recognition.\nPeer-to-peer recognition crowdsources recognition – having more eyes, ears and hearts looking for and capturing recognition moments.\nChallenge your approach for determining who gets recognized\nThe next part of making recognition unified and inclusive has to do with who can receive recognition, and I believe this is an area where much work still needs to be done. Too often, we put limits on who can be recognized, e.g. only one person can win employee of the month, or only six people can win employee of the year, etc. By doing this it can create feelings of exclusion, create negative reactions and reduce the impact and power of recognition.\nWe need to practice equal opportunity recognition, looking at recognition through an inclusion lens, making sure that everyone has an equal opportunity to be noticed, appreciated and recognized.\nS – Shine a spotlight on recognition\nLet’s next move on to the letter ‘S,’ which stands for shining a spotlight on recognition. In the past, recognition was done in a very private way, between the sender and the receiver, but over the years we’ve come to see the importance of changing this to put it under the spotlight and watch the magic happen. The benefit is that it showcases what good and great look like to your workforce, it multiplies the impact as others see and get involved with the recognition, and it connects your people in a positive, meaningful and uplifting way.\nHere are four examples from my book on how companies do this:\nShare through a recognition platform\nAt Reward Gateway, when employees send one another recognition e-cards they appear on a social recognition digital wall. From here, anyone can comment or post reactions, participating and engaging with the recognition.\nShare stories at company meetings\nAt Atlassian, they share and showcase recognition stories during the monthly global town hall call, with the sender telling the story and sharing the positive behaviours.\nShare stories during onboarding\nAt the University of Lincoln, they take case studies from their annual recognition awards and weave them into their onboarding process to show what good looks like and to highlight how recognition is done.\nCreate digital badges.\nAt Shell Energy Retail, they created digital badges that employees are awarded for receiving three or more recognition nominations for the same company value. These can then be displayed in their email signature, which showcases to their global colleagues over and over again their recognition actions.\nT – Make recognition timely\nThe last letter of the acronym is ‘T,’ which stands for making recognition timely, and focuses on the ‘when’ of recognition. We’ve made strides in this area, reflecting on what we’ve learned and how we’ve responded to changes in the workplace, but there is still much work to be done. According to one survey, only 36% of companies are giving timely recognition, meaning that employees at six in 10 companies are having to wait to receive recognition.\nThe word ‘timely’ means to do something in an appropriate time frame, which is a bit wishy-washy,  as what does ‘appropriate time frame’ really mean? I believe that this is part of the problem as we all interpret it differently. Does it mean giving recognition once a week, once a month? What, exactly, is the ‘appropriate time frame’ to give recognition? I propose that instead, we focus the definition and our efforts on the gap, the time frame between the moment the behaviour or action happens and the moment the recognition occurs. If we remove the hurdles and make giving recognition easy, there is no excuse for waiting, and we can all move to what is commonly called “in the moment” recognition.\nWhy wait until a certain day of the week or month to give recognition, why not give it now before you forget AND the impact of the recognition wears off?\nI hope you’ve found these golden rules, and this acronym, helpful. I encourage you to use them to design or redesign your recognition programmes, ensuring they help you deliver appreciation in a meaningful and effective way.\nRecognition",

    "content": "How one small gesture made over 600,000 people understand the importance of employee engagement\nDebra Corey\nMay 22, 2019\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nDec 19, 2020\nI’ve spent hours, if not days, writing blogs to help and inspire others when it comes to how to treat their employees. They’ve made a difference, but not in the way that a short (and quick) post on LinkedIn did about an engaged employee of KLM. At the time of writing this blog it’s had over 600,000 views, 100 reshares, 4,600 reactions and 140 comments, which is far from my normal response rate.\nThe purpose of this blog is to first of all thank everyone for jumping into the conversation to celebrate this level of customer service and engagement, but also to tell the full story. For if you think the small part of the story I shared was amazing, wait until you hear the rest of it!\nIt began the night before my flight, when I received an email from the airline, KLM, saying that for a small amount of money I could upgrade to business class. Knowing that I would be exhausted after standing on my feet all day leading two engagement workshops, I jumped at the chance.\nScore 1 for KLM, making this experience available to me at a fair price.\nIt continued as I boarded the plane, settled into my seat, and listened as the flight attendants greeted the boarding passengers. Where normally attendants would pleasantly say hello, what happened here went well above and beyond. They chatted to everyone, talking about their trip, their clothes, telling jokes, and so much more. I sat and laughed, thinking to myself how impressed I was with how genuine and caring the team was.\nScore 2 for KLM, showing from the start that their team cared about customers as humans not just numbers.\nMy next encounter with great customer service, and the part I shared in my post, happened when I asked the flight attendant for a cookie. I told her that I had a train ride after my flight, and would love a cookie to have on this last leg of my journey. She smiled at me, walked away, and came back with a bag which contained a small bottle of wine, cookies and nuts.\nScore 3 for KLM, taking into consideration the needs of their customers to do what was right for them.\nThe story finished when I stopped the flight attendant to thank her and her team for everything. I told her that I had spent 2 days leading workshops on helping businesses drive employee engagement, and wished I could bottle up her engagement and deliver it to others. I asked her what it was that KLM did to make her love her job and be so engaged.\nShe answered that it was having the freedom to do what was right for the customers, being able to make a difference to others. She then disappeared and brought back a card for me which said:\nThank you for your huge compliment. At KLM we love our job, and we hope to pass our love on to our passengers.\nScore 4 for KLM, creating jobs and giving employees the freedom to do what is right to deliver fantastic customer service.\nI love this story because it shows the true power of employee engagement. How by trusting your employees,  giving them freedom and autonomy to do the right thing and information (such as your mission, purpose and values) to understand what is ‘right’, magic will truly happen – for the customer, for the company and for the employee!\nNormally I’d share statistics supporting the impact of employee engagement, but instead let me end by sharing just a few of the many comments made on my post:\nGreat to hear when employees are celebrated for taking initiative like this – making memorable experiences and customers for life.\nPerfect example of how an engaged employee will proactively look after the customer.\nTrusting employees to do the right thing, rather than restricting them by working practices and processes based on not trusting them.\nThis is an example of meaningful work creating value and a great employee experience creating a great customer.\nThis is how a company takes care of its customers, by taking care of their employees first. They then pass it on to the customer.\nGreat story of an empowered employee who doesn’t need to seek permission just does what’s right.\nThe true value of a highly engaged employee is both long-term AND a lasting testimony to customers as to the “heart” of that company.\nWhen your employees know they can go the extra mile for clients, you’ll see amazing examples of empathy.\nEmployee empowerment ripples into great customer service. The little things make a huge difference.\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "3 reasons you’re never too old to innovate\nDebra Corey\nOct 23, 2018\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nDec 19, 2020\nA few years ago I was looking for a new job when a recruiter called to tell me that I was ‘the’ perfect person for a role he was looking to fill. It was for a global company, one that was expanding quickly, and would benefit from my experience as a global rewards leader. Great, I said, feel free to submit my resume.\nWhat happened next surprised and bewildered me, for a day later the recruiter called back to say that the company didn’t want to interview me because I was, and I quote, “too old to be innovative”.\n“Are you sure they read my entire resume?” I said, “Reading all of the innovative programs I’ve put in place and the awards my teams and I have won over the last 20+ years I’ve worked in HR?”\n“Yes” he said apologetically, “I tried to point this out to them, but they wouldn’t budge. They want someone young and innovative.”\nI share this story because I never want this to happen to anyone, regardless of their age or any other differing characteristic.\nSo, for my part I’ve gone out to the ‘King of Innovation’, Dominic Price, Work Futurist at Atlassian, asking him, why he thinks innovation has no age limits”? Here are Dom’s three responses to this question:\n1. Innovation is a mindset not an age.\nAs long as you’re a fully-formed adult, you’re well capable of being innovative.\nRead\nDom’s blog\nwhich tells you the 5 signs that you’re working with a fully-formed adult.\nMy thoughts: Agree, we should not assume that just because you’re young you are innovative, or on the flip side that because you are old you are wise.  It’s up the individual, and as Dom says, their mindset.\n2. Innovation is about admitting you’re wrong.\nThe growth mindset enables us to think about the upside of exploration and experimentation. But to truly value that, you have to admit that your idea by yourself will never be as good as a cognitively diverse set of people working together. That diversity and sparring feels like a tax at first, but turns into an investment as you listen to the ideas and challenge of the people around you.\nMy thoughts: Agree, innovative doesn’t just require, but it demands diversity of thought. And you’ll never get this if you sit in a room with like-minded or same age people.\n3. Tenure does NOT = initiative.\nRead\nDom’s blog\nwhere he talks about this and don’t miss the interesting comments at the end.\nMy thoughts: Agree, innovation can and will come from anyone as long as they keep their skills and mind fresh.\nMy husband, an ace developer is a perfect example of this, as he spends more time than anyone I know making sure he is up-to-date on anything and everything.\n“It is time that we stop thinking about this demographic (older workers) as a liability and instead recognize them as assets, and work across sectors to help break down barriers to unleash their potential.”\nThomas Schøtt, Professor of Entrepreneurship at the University of Southern Denmark.\nSo in ending, if the person who failed to see the innovation in me is reading this, let me tell you that you missed out.  For I’ve continued to put in place innovative programs and I’ve even co-written a book on innovative thought called\n‘Build it. A rebel playbook for employee engagement’.\nNot bad for an old and experienced lady!\nLooking for more tips on how to bring innovation into your workplace, helping your diverse teams come up with brilliant ideas faster?  Here’s a link to\nAtlassian’s play\nto help you with this.  Thanks Dom!\nEmployee Engagement",

And not only a book, but a book that is going to help others in my profession, and a book that has directly led to me landing an amazing job in an amazing company.  How’s that for lemonade!\nLet me start from the beginning, which was a year and a few months ago.  I’d gone into work after the holiday season to be told that I was being made redundant (for non-UK readers this means that my company had decided they no longer needed my job . . . or me!).  I’ve had this happen to me before, having been in the workplace for over 30 years, but this was made even worse by the fact that I had just picked up and moved my family, and we were in the middle of selling our old house and buying a new one. More lemons and more stress!\nNeedless to say, I came home shocked and scared, wondering how I was going to keep up a brave front for my children, and get through not only finding a new job but sorting out the challenges we were having buying and selling homes (which in the UK is not very straightforward!).\nVery early on in the process, my husband and I decided that we were going to handle both of these in the ‘right’ way – I was going to find not just any job but the ‘right’ job, and we weren’t going to settle on any house, but the ‘right’ house for our kids and us. Good decisions, but more lemons!\nI began by taking charge of my lemons, putting on my determined and optimistic persona.  This is when I came up with the idea of a book, deciding that it would be the perfect way to occupy my time, my mind, and my energies….doing something constructive with my lemons!\nI had never written a book before, and in fact it wasn’t something that had been high on my bucket list. It just hit me one day, I had something that I passionately wanted to write about, communications, and this was the perfect time to give it a go. Now I’m not saying it was easy, and using the lemon/lemonade analogy, I probably didn’t have the proper ‘tools’ to make lemonade, but hey, I did it and it ended up being something that I am extremely proud of and as I mentioned at the start, will help others.\nLet me jump now to the other happy ending to my story, and that is about me finding the ‘right’ job. I had almost finished my book, and was asked to speak at a seminar about the model I created and explained in the book. I showed up, did my presentation and then sat back to listen to the next speaker, Glenn Elliott (CEO and Founder of Reward Gateway).\nWhat can I say about Glenn, he and his story was so inspirational that I asked him if I could interview him for the book. We met up for the interview, I got my fantastic story for the book, and then Glenn completely surprised me and offered me a role he decided to create after hearing me speak. I knew immediately it was the ‘right’ job for me, especially as I had walked away from others that didn’t sound or feel right.  This was an even better happy ending than I could have ever imagined.\nGlenn and I when we first met at Engagement Excellence Live\nSo what did this teach me and what do I want to share with you?\nThe first lesson was about the lemons – specifically their purpose.  I learned that lemons don’t have to be something bad if you use them to create the right ‘recipe’.\nAvoid them and/or let them overpower you, and you end up with a bunch of useless ingredients or even worse rotten lemons surrounded by green mould!\nWe need to take the time to understand them, and like ingredients in a recipe, understand if/where they fit in, and how they should be used.\nThe next lesson is about the ‘recipe’ itself – what you decide to do with the lemons.  For me, it was writing a book, as I thought it would give me purpose and outcome which I’d be proud of.\nFor you it may be different, but the point is, don’t start doing anything with the lemons until you decide what the recipe is going to be.\nThe final point is one that works alongside the others, and that is to have belief and trust in yourself.  Believe that you can handle the lemons, and you can create a recipe which is right for you. I had never written a book before, but that didn’t stop me (or my publisher) from believing in me, which is why I strongly believe that I’ve been able to achieve my happy ending.\nAs Arianna Huffington suggests in her book “Thrive”, you need to ‘evict your obnoxious roommate’, those negative thoughts that make you think you can’t do things.\nIn closing, my wish for you is that if you find yourself in a situation where you are handed lemons …..you find your own way to use them to create your own happy ending!\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "Three reasons why we all need and crave recognition\nDebra Corey\nJan 17, 2023\n3 min read\nThere’s no denying that we’re all different. But just like DNA, which is actually 99% the same between all humans, there is also much that we have in common. One such area has to do with recognition and appreciation, which is something that we all need and crave no matter who we are, where we live, what role we perform, and how we work.\nSome of you may not believe this to be true, that surely there are people who do not need and certainly do not crave recognition. To this, let me challenge you as you read through this blog to find a person where at least one of the reasons does not apply. For although they may not all tick everyone’s box, I firmly believe that there’s something for everyone through recognition and appreciation when it’s done well.\nSo without further ado, here are three things that recognition and appreciation can do, and thus why we all need and crave it:\n1. It makes us happy\nThere are chemicals in our brain that play a role in when and how we experience happiness, for when they’re released, they trigger feelings that drive our happiness. They impact our mood as well as our feelings of satisfaction, importance and connection, all important to our physical and emotional wellbeing.\nScience has found that three of these chemicals (dopamine, serotonin and oxytocin) are released when we’re recognized, and feel appreciated. And better yet, this chemical release “cements the knowledge that more of that behavior will create more praise, resulting in another chemical drench”.\nOn the flip side, the dark side, when the expected recognition does not happen, chemical levels drop, which can lead to employees avoiding thankless tasks and putting in less effort. To illustrate this, here’s a photo I often share when talking about the impact of demotivated and disengaged employees, showing how the employee cares so little about the task that they can’t be bothered to move the stick out of the road!\n2. It satisfies our needs\nThe next reason relates to Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, which I’m sure you’re familiar with as it’s been around since 1943. As the model shows, once we get past the first two levels of needs, physiological and safety, we move onto ones such as love and belonging, esteem, and self-actualization.\nRecognition has an important role to play in satisfying all of these needs as it contributes to a sense of belonging, helps us feel more respected and confident, and helps us be the best we can be. And as the hierarchy and model show, these are important to fulfil in order to not just survive but to be fully motivated.\n3. It helps us perform at our best\nAnd finally, recognition can help our people and businesses perform at their best as it ignites a long list of superpowers, turning our people into superheroes.\nAs you’ll see below, the list is quite extensive both in what they are and the difference and impact they can make. I’ll explain them all in detail in another blog, but at a high level, here are the 10 areas where recognition and appreciation can deliver power to your people and company:\nMore engaged\nBetter sense of belonging\nHappier\nBetter overall wellbeing\nLess burned out\nMore trusting\nBetter sense of awareness\nMore productive\nStronger business results\nBetter employee retention\nI hope that this blog has been helpful in highlighting the reasons that recognition and appreciation are so important. Please do use it if and when you work with people who don’t believe in, and thus action it, helping them understand why it’s so needed and craved around the world. All the best!\nIf you're interested in reading my books on recognition and appreciation, they are:\nAppreciate it! The Playbook for Employee Recognition\nSee it. Say it. Appreciate it!

    "content": "5 Tips for using the Great Boss Building Block Model\nDebra Corey\nMar 4, 2024\n4 min read\nKnowing how to use tools is key to their (and your) success. Get them right, and they will help you achieve your objectives. Get them wrong, and you will not only fail, but you can achieve results far worse than when you began.\nIn a previous blog we introduced you to the Great Boss Building Block™ model, something we developed to provide you with the right tools to deliver the right results.\nTo help you use this model and the 14 building block tools effectively, in this blog we share five key points to keep in mind. Think of them as your instructional manual for using these tools. Here they are:\n1)  Don’t wait for perfection\nFirst, it’s important to note that you don’t have to be perfect at using a building block in order to start using it with your people. Keep in mind that nothing will ever be perfect; making progress on individual building blocks is what truly makes a difference.\n\"Done is better than perfect\" - Sheryl Sandberg.\nFor example, if your focus is the Appreciation block because your people have said they don’t feel valued at work, you can take small steps to work toward completing this block before a formal program is put in place. You can start by doing some small acts of appreciation on your own. Maybe start each weekly team meeting with “Shout Outs,” thanking individual people for the great work they had done. You’ll be surprised how a small act of gratitude can have a huge impact.\n2) Order doesn’t matter\nNext, it’s important not to take the placings of the building blocks too literally. It’s not a model where you start at the bottom and work your way up, or go left to right. You need to set your own order and develop your great boss plan based on focus areas where you will make the biggest and quickest impact – remember, the enemy of progress is inertia.\nFor example, if after taking the\nboss assessment test\nyou find that you need to focus on Listening and Compassion, start with these blocks. If your people have shared that what they need most from you is Coaching and Development, you should start there. Bottom line: Consider the building blocks needed for your current situation and create an order that delivers what you and your people need most.\n3)  Be flexible and fluid\nAs we all know, things are constantly changing. Whether it’s the workplace, your people, or your job, nothing seems to ever stand still for long. That’s why it’s important to continually revisit both your building blocks and your priorities, focusing on blocks that are most timely and relevant. Be flexible in your approach and open-minded to how and when you need to change your plan.\nFor example, let’s say you prioritize Feedback and Listening based on assessing your people’s needs, your own strengths, and learning opportunities. You start the work only to find out that the company is going through a huge reorganization, and you’re going to have to tell people that their jobs are changing or layoffs are happening. You may want to shift your focus to Compassion and Communication so that you feel comfortable handling these new responsibilities.\n4)  It takes practice\nThere are times when you put time and effort into a building block, and it feels like an uphill battle. You read the sections, you take the actions suggested, and …. you feel like you’re getting nowhere. You try it again and again, nowhere! Well, you’re not alone. When this has happened to me, here are three noteworthy lessons I keep in mind.The first lesson is that it takes time. You likely won’t start to see dependable, reliable change on day 1, or 10, or even longer. You need to keep putting in the time if you want change to happen. The next lesson is the old adage that “practice makes perfect.” And that’s because although some blocks may come more easily and naturally to you, others may not, requiring more time and more practice. The final lesson relates to Einstein’s quote, “Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, expecting the same results.”\nFor example, if you’re working on the Feedback block, but every time you give feedback you still don’t seem to get it right. Remember not to give up, but try a different approach. Talk to your people, get ideas from your peers, and find out what’s working and not working, then try it again.\n5) Everyone is different\nAnd finally, remember that everyone is different, and one approach may work with one person but not with another. Figure out what will work for\nthem\n, and then adjust how\nyou’ll change\nto meet their needs.\nFor example, one person on my team liked me to give feedback to them in a very direct way. “Just get to the point,” they’d say to me. While another person wanted me to build up to it, and give them time to prepare for what I was going to share with them. I needed to understand this first so that I could give them what they needed.\nWe hope these five tips help you use the model and the building blocks in ways that help your people, business, and you be a great boss.

    "content": "6 steps for communicating with IMPACT\nDebra Corey\nNov 3, 2015\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nJan 1, 2021\nNowadays, we are bombarded with messages every hour of every day. So how do we make ours stand out so that we can make an impact on our employees, and ultimately the business?\nI’d like to say that there is a simple answer or a miracle cure, but unfortunately I’d be lying!\nCommunicating effectively takes hard work, collaboration and a dash of creativity. However, I do have one word which will help you as you develop your next communications campaign, Impact.\nImpact is a six step communications model which I have developed, it was designed to help myself and others understand and action the key steps of effective and impactful communication campaigns.\nI = Investigation\nInvestigation is about taking the time to uncover and review all of the facts before developing your communications campaign strategy and plan. It is also about using these facts to develop not only your plan but your objectives. By creating objectives from the outset, you will ensure that you have clear and meaningful goals by which to develop and measure your communications.\nM = Medium\nMedium is about determining which medium(s) are appropriate in order to deliver the most effective communications campaign, whether that be print, live or digital. It is critical to select those which best fit your company’s objectives, culture, demographics and timelines, getting the right mix for your organisation.\nP = Planning\nPlanning is about creating a comprehensive, coordinated and collaborative approach to planning and running your communications campaign. Being clear about what needs to be done by whom and by when, thus ensuring that all timelines and objectives are met.\nA = Allies\nAllies is about bringing together and working with the right colleagues so that your campaign is run smoothly and effectively. It’s about understanding who are the ‘right’ allies to best deliver on your objectives, and working with them in an effective and efficient manner.\nC = Content\nContent is about creating messages and graphics which ‘stick’, meaning they will encourage your employees to take the time to read, think and behave differently. The is done by creating content which is valuable, relevant and consistent, and it is also about understanding if or when you need to segment the content to appeal to a variety of audiences.\nT = Testing\nTesting is about collecting data which can demonstrate the effectiveness of your communications campaign, and thus the ROI (return on investment) to your business. It is also about using the data throughout the campaign to adjust or update to drive effectiveness.\nThis model and this approach will work if you do the work required for each and every step.\nOne thing to point out which differentiates this particular model from others is that it is not sequential – you don’t start one step and then move onto the next, something I believe to cause problems in a communications campaign. You need to have a fluid and flexible approach, working through each step in a joined up and cohesive approach.\nThink of yourself as a chef in a competition, being asked to prepare a five course meal in order to win the big prize. Have you ever seen how they work on the various courses simultaneously, making sure that they are all served at the right time? By following this approach of juggling all steps, going back to each ‘course’ (step) over and over again to make sure it is just right, you ensure that your ‘meal’ or your communications campaign is something which your audience will love and will want to come back to for ‘seconds’ (to action). By remembering each ‘ingredient’ (each step) and preparing them in a coordinated way you will end up with a fabulous meal (communications campaign).

    "content": "How we all can, and must, learn to flip in both directions\nDebra Corey\nOct 20, 2018\n4 min read\nUpdated:\nDec 19, 2020\nWhen I was young I was a gymnast, in fact I was a competitive gymnast. For those of you who know me, you’re probably not surprised by this, as I have a competitive attitude and nature in pretty much everything I do.\nHowever, what you may not know about me is that although I loved doing anything in the forward direction, I absolutely hated doing most things in a backward direction. Why?  Well because when going forward I could see where I was going, but going backward I could not.  It was this fear of the unknown, the uncertainty of how and where my feet and body would end up that scared me.\nHowever, as a competitor, I pushed through this, got over my fears and just did it. Yes, it took longer for me to master the skill, but in the end I succeeded.\nI’ve been thinking about this a lot lately as I get ready to learn my new backwards ‘skill’, which begins in January when I move to spending half my time doing what I love in helping the team at Reward Gateway, and the other half of my time doing what I love in my new independent role as a PIFA.\nWhat you ask, does PIFA stand for?  If you google it, it stands for Pennsylvania Intercollegiate Football Association, which is odd as I was born in Pennsylvania, but to me it stands for Pay It Forward Ambassador. In this role I’ll be doing things I’ve learned that I love doing, which are speaking, running workshops, and even a bit of consulting so that I can, you guessed it, pay it forward.\nAm I scared, yes! What if I can’t do it and land flat on my face? The answer to this question is that yes, I will most certainly fall flat on my face, and yes, I will most likely do this a few times. However, the other answer to this question is that yes, I will be fine in the end, and I will learn the new skill and meet my objectives.\nAnd the reason I’ll be fine are these three things, which in my first act as PIFA, I’ll share with you so that you too will feel confident as you attempt your next backward ‘skill’.\nI’ve been training for this for years.\nAlthough it’s a new ‘skill’, I need to remind myself that I’ve actually been training for this my entire career. I’ve been an HR leader for 30 years, a writer for 5 years, and a rebel for the past 2. So everything I’ve learned will serve as a foundation to help me master this new skill.\nIn gymnastics this meant that when I fell it wouldn’t hurt as much, as I learned how to adjust my body as I was flying through the air. In the workplace, the same is true, as I’ll be able to read the signs and adjust my plan as I move forward.\nI have an awesome support network.\nWhen I was gymnast I was surrounded by amazing coaches that could watch over and support me as I learned my new skills, picking me up and dusting me off as I got up to try the skill again.\nThe same is true in the workplace, as I need to remind myself that I have an absolutely awesome support network that I can draw from during this time of uncertainty. Especially in such a social world, supporters can be reached, and respond, in an instant if we only go out and ask for it.\nI’ll make a difference.\nAnd last but not least, I need to remind myself why I’m learning a new skill to begin with, which is to make a difference in my capacity as a PIFA.  I am committed to fundamentally helping others create more successful businesses by treating their people in new and rebellious ways.\nThis is what Glenn Elliott and I write about in our book, ‘\nBuild it: A rebel playbook for employee engagement\n‘, and this is the message that I want to get out there.\nWhat I’ve learned in the eight months I’ve been travelling the world speaking and holding workshops on this topic is that others believe and are committed to this cause as well. And by helping them by inspiring them to think and act differently, sharing stories, tips and tools, together we can as Reward Gateway’s mission statement says ‘make the world a better place to work’.\nSo to end this blog, and to inspire us all as we set out to learn and achieve our new backward skills, here are two quotes from two fantastic books I’m currently reading:\n“You can’t get to courage without rumbling with vulnerability. Embrace the suck.”  Dr. Brené Brown, ‘\nDare to Lead’.\n“To move forward in many areas of life it is sometimes necessary to change radically, to start a new course that will be different from the existing one, often requiring a whole new way of looking at a familiar problem.” Charles Handy, ‘\nThe Second Curve\n’.\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "Four things the pandemic has taught us about employee recognition\nDebra Corey\nOct 5, 2020\n4 min read\nThroughout the pandemic we’ve seen a change in why and how we recognise one another. Just look on social media, and you’ll see story after story of people cheering, clapping and even singing and dancing to send thanks. No trophies, money, just heartfelt and genuine appreciation.\nIn this blog I’d like to pause a moment and explore what we’ve learned about recognition during the pandemic, and how to translate these learnings into recognising our workforce going forward:\n1. Recognition does more than drive performance\nIn many organisations, recognition is used as a performance tool, rewarding and recognising those that have excelled through extraordinary performance. And while this is still an important objective of recognition, during the pandemic we’ve also seen that in a world filled with uncertainty and challenges, recognition can be used as a way to give hope and strength to our workforce, lifting their spirits and helping them be more resilient.\nBy recognising one another, we feel a sense of security, we know that we matter, and we feel better equipped to tackle the unknowns and the challenges that we face. And for this reason, I believe that recognition should be used to only just drive performance, but drive wellbeing, acting as a way to help our employees be their best by feeling appreciated and valued.\nAn example of a company who’s used recognition in this way throughout the pandemic is EDF Energy, sending mailings to each and every employee during the lockdown period to make them feel appreciated:\nThe first mailing was sent out at the beginning of lockdown, and included a tea bag, a cookie, and a note that said “We’re really grateful for everything you do, and think you’re one smart cookie.”\nAnother mailing was sent in July, and included pick n mix sweets and a note that said “If we could choose our colleagues we’d definitely pick you. Thank you for your hard work.”\nAnd finally, employees received a ‘Little Box of Appreciation’, containing over recognition cookies and 50 recognition notes. The notes were of inspiration, gratitude and motivation, and came with instructions to open when needed.\n2. Recognition connects us to one another\nAnother aspect of wellbeing has to do with relationships, for as social beings we need to connect with one another. Without this, research has shown an impact on our physical and emotional health, leading to depression, anxiety and increased stress.\nIn the past, recognition has been seen as a way to showcase what good looks like, putting the spotlight on actions and behaviours that the company wants replicated to drive performance. And whilst this is still important, we’ve also seen how connecting employees through ‘shared recognition’, it helps them feel less isolated, inviting them to join in on recognition moments. Going forward, we need to find ways to use recognition in this way, making the spotlight shine brighter and in more directions, helping to build more frequent and stronger connections.\nAn example of a company who’s used recognition in this way during the pandemic is Dunelm, who created a new set of eCards that became part of their social recognition platform. These new eCards had a home theme since colleagues were spending more time at home, and focused on appreciating one another, being part of a team, looking out for each other, and doing well despite the circumstances. They’ve been a huge success, with 4 times more of these eCards being sent than in the past, showing the importance of recognising and connecting with one another during these challenging times.\n3. It’s the little things that matter\nIn a world that’s changing by the minute, when a day feels like a week or a month, companies have found that you can no longer wait for the big recognition moments - those monthly, quarterly or annual programmes. For although they may still have a place in your recognition strategy, you also need to design recognition programmes for ‘in the moment’ achievements, recognising those small wins that are helping your people and business survive in these challenging times and beyond.\nGoing forward, every recognition programme needs to have some element of ‘in the moment’ recognition, using it as a way to let your employees know that every small impact they make contributes and makes a difference, and that you appreciate them when it happens . . . . not a month, quarter or year later!\n4. Recognition isn’t about the money\nLast, but certainly not least, we’ve learned that we don’t need to spend a lot of money to recognise and make our employees feel appreciated. With businesses struggling during the pandemic, companies have been forced to get creative with how they recognise their employees, and they’ve done a brilliant job!\nCompanies have gone back to the phrase “It’s the thought that counts”, finding no or low cost ways to recognise their employees, focussing more on the ‘why’, ‘how’ and ‘when’, and less on the ‘what’. So whether it’s eCards or shout outs at the end of virtual team meetings, which cost nothing, we all need to re-think and re-look at what we do to recognise our workforce.\nAn example of a company who’s used recognition in this way during the pandemic is Welcome Break. To thank their employees for their contributions during lockdown, they created their own version of the UK Thursday night clap for the NHS celebration. They created a short ‘Clap for the Team’ video that included each member of the leadership team saying thank you as they clapped, with the overall message being “tonight we clap for you.”\nSo as you look at your recognition strategy and programmes for the future, I encourage you to consider what we’ve learned about recognition throughout the pandemic. Weave these into why and how you recognise, and don’t be tempted to go back to the ‘old ways’ that will be obsolete as we move forward in this new world of work.\nThis blog was originally posted on\nHR Zone\n.\nRecognition",

    "content": "Is motivation as simple as a cuppa?\nDebra Corey\nOct 18, 2018\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nDec 19, 2020\nI was walking my dogs the other day, and on the way passed a man who was high up in a tree with only a harness holding him in place. At first I thought he was doing a bit of exercise, but quickly realized that he was there to do a job, which was to cut down the tree. I said hello, wished him well, and went on my usual dog walk. To my surprise, when I passed him again an hour later I found the man firmly on the ground, and the tree completely chopped down.\nI said to him that I was surprised at how quickly he had completed the task, as in the past I’d seen it take hours to cut down such a large tree.\nWith a smile on his face he replied to me “I was motivated by a cuppa, as I knew I would have a nice one when I finished the job.” I walked away thinking, is motivation as simple as this, is it as simple as a cuppa?\nSo when I got home I decided to ask my son this question, what is your ‘cuppa’ when it comes to motivation? As a normal teenager, he was firmly connected to his iPad playing the latest computer game.\nWhen I was finally able to get his attention and pry him away from the screen, I asked him, what motivates you to try so hard to do well with your computer games?  e said it was a few things, the first being satisfaction, knowing and feeling that he had done well. The second was the achievement of different levels, for the better you do in the game the higher the level and the more items you get (e.g. swords, gold, etc.).\nI then decided to get two more perspectives, increasing my sample size, so asked the question to my dogs, Poppy and Java. I asked them, what motivates you to listen to my commands when we are walking in the fields?\nPoppy barked back that to her it was simple, it was the anticipation of a treat, which in her case is not a cuppa but a doggie biscuit. But for Java it was different, for him it was all about pleasing me and feeling appreciated for being a well-behaved dog.\nSo what do these examples say about motivation, and what do they teach us about how best to motivate our employees at our companies?\nThe first observation is that there are some employees like the tree surgeon and my dog Poppy who are purely driven by one basic thing, whether that is a cuppa or a doggie biscuit. For them, we need to understand exactly what motivates them, giving them that warm feeling through the most appropriate ‘cuppa’. Is it something tangible, like a treat, or could it be as simple as a thank you or some kind of recognition programme?\nFor others, like my son and Java, they actually have two different motivators, an extrinsic one (e.g. recognition to the outside world for their contributions and achievements) and an intrinsic one (e.g. pride in what they do and achieve). Because of this we have two key factors that we need to understand and address.\nThe first is similar to the first group, which is to understand exactly what meets their extrinsic motivation, so gives them their ‘cuppa’. The second addresses the intrinsic motivation, which can be a bit trickier as it’s less about how you recognise them and more about the opportunity and support you give them to perform and thus achieve their intrinsic motivation. It’s important to consider this not just when creating motivation and recognition programmes but also when designing jobs.\nSo no matter the size of your company or the industry you are in, motivating your employees is key to the success of your business.  Just like having an ROI (return on investment) of your HR programs, our employees are looking for their ROI, which for them would be their ROI (return on effort).\nOur job in HR is to understand whether it is a cuppa, a doggie treat, a new sword for their computer game, or a variety of other tools we have available to us. So go out and find what’s best for your business and your employees and . . . have yourself a cuppa once you’ve sorted it all out!\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "Stop letting false successes define you!\nDebra Corey\nJan 18, 2019\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nDec 19, 2020\nI tossed and turned all night long questioning and doubting myself. Why did ‘success’ escape me yet again? What did I do wrong? But then I thought to myself, am I asking the wrong questions? Instead shouldn’t I be asking myself these questions – what is success, and, more importantly – what successes do I want to define me?\nBefore I go on, let me take a step back. The situation was that our book (Build it: The rebel playbook for employee engagement) was entered for an award. It was a book I was hugely proud of, so in this situation success would be determined if we won an award. Well to cut to the end, it wasn’t even shortlisted! And to make things worse, a few months back I was entered for ‘engagement professional of the year’, and guess what, again, I wasn’t even shortlisted!\nWith all that I’ve done over the last year to write and publish a best-selling book, travel the world sharing the key messages and helping others and finally, helping to drive employee engagement at my previous company, Reward Gateway, surely I’d be worthy of at least being shortlisted for one of these awards?! Not! But should I care? Should I care more about the good that myself and the book have delivered? Should I really care, and have sleepless nights, based on what a group of judges have decided? Why let this define me?\nI’m telling you this because I think that too often we do this to ourselves and to our employees, defining and evaluating success in the wrong way. If we truly want to achieve and feel that we’ve achieved and succeeded, we need to change how we do this!  Here are my thoughts on three ways we can and should do this:\nFocus on what really matters.\nWe shouldn’t always go for the obvious definitions of success, like in my case winning awards. Focus on what will really make the biggest difference, like in my case, how many people has the book and my talks and workshops helped. Sure, celebrate awards if they happen, but think of them a ‘nice to have’ and not a ‘have to have’.\nKeep things fluid.\nAs Jill Katz talks about in her\nvideo\non goal setting, we need to keep things fluid and continuous, always re-setting and re-evaluating our goals and what success looks like. By doing this we make sure that we’re aiming for what is appropriate, realistic and achievable.\nDon’t forget to celebrate.\nI’m a big fan of celebrating, recognizing not just the actual achievements, but the steps that you take both towards and away from them. This helps keep you focussed and at the same time gives you the boost of confidence you need as you are taking the steps toward your achievements. This should include failures, or what I’ve heard called ‘learning moments’ (love it!), as this also helps you on your journey to success.\nSo in ending, let me thank all of you who have helped me feel successful in achieving my goals, which are to pay it forward by helping you and your companies achieve your objectives. I may not win awards for this, but you are my awards, and I will remember and celebrate these often! And, by the way, for those of you who were shortlisted and win the awards, congratulations, I am truly happy for you!\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "3 tips for developing behaviors, your \"tools\" for using your company values\nDebra Corey\nMar 9, 2021\n3 min read\nLet me ask you a question - if someone handed you a tool, would you automatically know how to use it? If you’re like me, the answer is most definitely, no . . . just ask my husband, who makes fun of me using every tool we have in the garden shed for the wrong purposes and in the wrong way!\nThe same is true with company values, our \"tools\" for driving our company’s purpose and mission. For without behaviors, or what I like to call our ‘user manual’, our people will never know what the values mean and how to use them.\nBut too often companies either don’t have behaviors or have behaviors that have not been developed in a strategic and effective way. So going back to my user manual analogy, they don’t clearly spell out the tasks and behaviors that are critical to use with our ‘tools’, our values. They leave too much to chance, which if you ever saw my garden that’s been tended by using tools incorrectly, is probably not the right thing to do!\nSo let me share with you three tips from my book “\nBringing Your Values Out to Play\n” on how to discover and design behaviors that will drive your values and your mission.\n1. Make them unique and meaningful to your organization and workforce\nIn the same way that values need to be unique and meaningful to your organization and to your workforce, so do your behaviors. They need to be driven by your mission and by the culture that you want and need to create and maintain.\nFor example, many companies use a value related to innovation, but the values and behaviors behind this can and should be very different. Here’s how it looks at three different companies:\nCompany 1:\nThey have a company values of:\nBe the change you seek.\nThe behaviors for this value are: Have the courage and resourcefulness to spark change - to make better our products, our people, our place.\nCompany 2:\nThey have a company value of:\nWe are curious.\nThe behaviors for this value are: We challenge the status quo, seek to understand our customers and resolve how we can do things better for them.\nCompany 3:\nThey have a company value of:\nCreativity.\nThe behaviors for this value are: Creativity is the ability to come up with ideas that are new, surprising and valuable - combining logic and reasoning with playfulness and imagination.\n2. Have them address, and thus overcome, your challenges\nIn user manuals, they clearly spell out the steps so their customers don’t encounter any problems and challenges. When it comes to behaviours, that’s exactly what companies need to do by first understanding the challenges, and then developing behaviours to help overcome them, having them be intentional and focussed.\nFor example, I was working with a company that was having problems with people working together across a very diverse organisation - they weren’t respecting each other, listening to each other, cooperating with each other - and it was getting in the way of them achieving their mission. With this in mind, we built behaviors into multiple values to address the problems head on, clearly explaining what was expected and acceptable through their behaviors.\nHere are a few examples of some of these behaviors to help illustrate this point:\nWe give each other our undivided attention in order to hear and understand each other's views, ideas and suggestions.\nWe seek to understand before reacting, not jumping in or making preconceived assumptions or judgements.\nWe take the time to get to know one another, understanding experiences, motivations, and challenges, removing unconscious biases in order to empathise and care for one another.\nWe are honest and vulnerable with one another without fear of judgement, sharing our weaknesses, limitations, doubts and fears.\nWe know that we cannot and should not do things alone, that being a hero isn’t right for us or for the business, so we collaborate, delegate and empower others.\n3. Consider and test every word you use\nAnd finally, if your behaviors are to be used and lived, they first need to do two things - 1) Be engaged with and 2) Be understood - both which can be quite difficult to achieve. To overcome these challenges, here are two suggestions:\nFind ways to capture your employees attention through the words that you use, having them align with your culture, your tone of voice, and what will resonate with them the most.\nConsider the interpretation across your very diverse workforce, testing them early and often in the process to make sure they are understood in the way that they are intended.\nAs I end this blog, let me challenge you to test your behaviors against these three tips, making sure that yours drive the actions and results that you desire. And if they don’t . . . . add to or change them!\nCompany Values",

    "content": "Living the Dream at John Good Group\nDebra Corey\nJul 15, 2024\n4 min read\nJohn Good Group is a company that is rooted in its heritage, and at the same time, in the future. Their philosophy brings this together by saying that “every day is an opportunity to celebrate the past and create bold new plans for the future.” This is evident in how they help businesses grow in sustainable ways, and in how they help their people in their strategic and innovative HR programs.\nA perfect example of this is their ‘Living the Dream’ program, which I first heard about when Rachel Lowe, Chief People Officer, posted about it on LinkedIn. I was so impressed and intrigued that I immediately messaged Rachel, asking if I could interview her to learn more about it. Here’s what she and Chloe Lawson, Junior People Advisor, shared with me.\nWhat is Living the Dream?\nLiving the Dream is John Good Group’s new people initiative that was developed as a way to show appreciation to their people by providing them with the opportunity to have a life-changing experience.\nAs Rachel and Chloe jointly explained, “We all have those dreams, aspirations, or unique experiences on our bucket list that we’ve been longing to achieve. At John Good Group, we want to change that, offering our employees the opportunity to make one of these dreams a reality completely on us. If you can dream it, we will make it happen.”\nThis special initiative takes place twice a year during our Summer and Christmas social events. During each event, one lucky employee’s name will be drawn, and they will win the experience of their lifetime. From the extravagant to the tame - flying a plane, scuba diving in The Great Barrier Reef, racing in a Lamborghini, trekking the Great Wall of China - employees enter their dream, and the company makes it happen.\nThe first winner was selected at their Christmas party, with their dream being to learn how to surf on Bondi Beach, Australia. And the second winner was just selected at their Summer BBQ, with their dream being to\nsee the lantern festival and wash elephants in Bali. Brilliant!\nWhy did you put ‘Living the Dream’ in place?\nAt John Good Group, their mission isn’t just about professional success, they’re dedicated to enhancing the personal lives of their employees as well. They do this through a variety of programs and initiatives (more on this below), but Adam Walsh, their new CEO, wanted to do something more. He wanted to put in place a new form of recognition, something everyone would love, and something to create memories to associate back to the company, especially as they continue to grow.\nThe result was the introduction of the ‘Living The Dream’ initiative. It most certainly meets the objective of enhancing the life of the winner, giving them the opportunity to have a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but even for those who don't win, they have that special moment of dreaming of their experience as they all wait for their name to be selected.\nHow have your employees reacted to the program?\nThere has been a real energy about the ‘Living the Dream’ program. According to Lowe, “It’s become the talking point in the staff breakout areas, with them sharing stories of what they want to do.”\nThis sense of energy has also gone into how they announce the winner, not merely calling out a name, but building up momentum and excitement. For the first reveal,\n“We wanted to build up the excitement in the room by not revealing the name straight away, but by announcing which business within the group the winner was from, and then revealing their dream, and finally the name,” said Lawson. For the most recent reveal, their CEO did it slightly differently, calling up to the stage everyone from group, then joked and said, “it’s none of you.” He then called forward employees from the winning Operating Company, and this time said, “it is one of you,” getting them all excited. Finally, he revealed the dream and the winner, love it!\nWhat other initiatives and programs do you have?\nThe ‘Living the Dream’ program does not stand alone, for at John Good Group they have a variety of other programs to show their employees that they value and support them. Here are just a few that stand out:\nLong service recognition\n- Their approach to long service is unique and aligns with their mission and values. First, because it begins at year 1, which is very different to many organizations. And second, because like the ‘Living the Dream’ program it also focuses on experiences and memories, with employees receiving vouchers for experience days in different ways and amounts based on their anniversary year.\nCharitable programs\n- The Matthew Good Foundation was created after Matthew Good’s death in June 2011 during a charity marathon. Matthew was part of the John Good Group family business and had a strong desire to create a positive impact on employees and communities. The Foundation supports their employees’ charitable activities in a variety of unique and meaningful ways, including monthly draws to win donations for the charity of their choice, championing small voluntary initiatives, double matching staff fundraising efforts, and providing funds and guidance to start their own grass-roots projects.\nLet me end by thanking John Good Group for sharing their story with me, and now with you. I hope it inspires you to find your own ways to support your people in creating memories and experiences.\nPlease\ncontact me\nif you'd like to discuss how you can create innovative and effective reward and recognition programs at your company.\nRecognition",

    "content": "3 Tips for Effective Communication\nDebra Corey\nJan 19, 2024\n2 min read\nI can’t tell you how many times I’ve seen communication go wrong. When the communicator spends countless hours crafting the perfect message to share an important message and . . . . it falls flat and/or doesn’t deliver as intended.\nSo that this doesn’t happen to you, here are three tips I shared when speaking to a group of managers the other day. I encourage you to keep these in mind as you craft your communications, and as you help your managers do the same.\nTip\n#1\n- Communicate the\nwhy\nThe starting point is to communicate and explain the “why.” For example, why is the change you’re communicating happening? Why are you launching a new program? Too often we either withhold the truth or don’t share the whole story, the entire ‘why’ when we communicate to our employees. By doing this, by not sharing the rationale, we risk them not fully understanding, buying into, and trusting the change.\n“Your employees deserve to hear the truth. And if you don’t tell them it, trust me, they’ll create their own version of the truth . .. . which is often worse than the actual truth!”\nIn this\nblog\nI share two examples of how we did this when making changes to existing programs. By doing this our communication began at the beginning of the “book” and not in the middle.\nTip\n#2\n- Communicate the\nwhat\nNext comes the “what,” so the details behind your communication, the steps to understanding it. As you do this it’s important to consider two things - First, what your people know and what they don’t know, and second, what they need and don’t need. Getting the detail and balance right is key to effective communication.\nTo help with this I encourage you to engage with your people to find out their knowledge and needs, and then test your communication once drafted to make sure the “what” is handled in the right way. It seems obvious, but just the other day a friend told me how her company launched a new benefit but failed to include an important “what,” which was what they needed to do to sign up for it. Don’t make basic mistakes, use others to help you with this step.\nTip\n#3\n- Communicate the\nhow\nAnd finally, it’s important to communicate the “how,” or what I like to call the WIIFM (what’s in it for me), which talks about how the communication impacts your people personally.\nAs I explain in another\nblog\non how to get your communications noticed, if you’re going to interrupt your employee’s day with your communications, you need to make it worthwhile and relevant for them, you need to deliver the WIIFM. Remember that your audience is ‘cold’, so currently not engaged with your communications and the topic. Ask yourself, what can I do to ‘defrost’ them, creating content to motivate your employees to complete the ‘purchase’.\nI hope you’ve found these three tips helpful, and can use them going forward to help design and deliver effective communications.\nPlease\ncontact me\nif you'd like to discuss how you can create more engaging content, or how to drive employee engagement at your company.\nTags:\nEmployee communication\nCommunication",

    "content": "Four ways to showcase your personality through employee recognition\nDebra Corey\nApr 27, 2022\n3 min read\nWe all have our own unique and special personality, something that shows to others the ways we think, act, and behave. And when it comes to your company, the same is absolutely true, with each company having its own unique and special personality, or as more commonly described,  its own company culture.\nAnd in this competitive and challenging workplace, your personality and culture is exactly what you need to be showcasing to your existing and potential employees. It’s what helps to differentiate you from your competitors, helping you stand out to win in the war for talent.\nBut this can only happen if you weave and showcase your personality and culture into your people programs, doing so in how you treat them throughout the entire employee experience. An example of this is with your company’s employee recognition programs, bringing your personality out to play in how you appreciate your people over and over again.\nTo bring this concept to life, let me share with you four examples of how companies are doing this from my latest book,\nAppreciate it! The Playbook for Employee Recognition\n.\nLife-size toy goat\nThe first example is from Zappos, an online retailer who believe that anything worth doing is worth doing with WOW, which they define as “doing something a little unconventional and innovative that has an emotional impact on the receiver.” And when it comes to recognition, they’ve absolutely delivered wow in both the depth and breadth of their formal and informal recognition programs, going above and beyond to help their employees, or what they call “Zapponians,” feel appreciated.\nAn example is their GOAT Award, which stands for greatest of all time, and is an award that has been developed for the customer loyalty team. Leaders from this group each month nominate someone who has really gone above and beyond, and then together select the person who most deserves the award. The recipient receives a traditional reward of a gift card, but in addition, they bring out the WOW by also giving them a life-size toy goat to celebrate their achievements.\nSpin of a recognition wheel\nThe next example is from Ascentis, one of the U.K.'s leading educational charities, who are not only committed to creating life-changing experiences and opportunities for their customers, but also for their people. This definitely comes across in how they recognize their people, as employees don’t just receive recognition, but experience it in their own fun and unique way.\nAn example is what happens when employees receive three celebration tickets, which are what managers can give out to employees for going above and beyond. They don’t get a stuffy gift, but they get a spin on what they call their “winning wheel,” which is where they can win prizes such as a day of annual leave, a treat basket, a double lunch break, cakes served in one of their themed rooms or even a secret lucky bag.\nAnother company who has a recognition wheel, or what they call their “Wheel of Wonders,” is Tony’s Chocoloney, a chocolate company based in the Netherlands. During the pandemic they adapted it to be the “QuaranTony Wheel”, that employees could spin after winning one of their many online quizzes or other virtual team activities taking place during lockdown. Some of the wheel prizes were a six-pack of Corona, toilet paper, a voucher for a visit to the hairdressers, a LEGO kit, a movie night kit, and a voucher for a meal cooked by their office chef.\nPicture on an aircraft\nThe next example is from InterGlobe Aviation Limited (IndiGo), India’s largest passenger airline, where they do something unique to recognize the winner of the Employee of the Quarter award. Winners of this award receive a gift voucher along with a money can’t buy gift, which is to have a photograph of them displayed on one of their aircrafts. And to make it even more special, their family is invited for the unveiling, creating a great moment of pride for the employee, their family and their colleagues.\nPersonalized bobbleheads\nAnd the final example is from Atlassian, a global enterprise software company who have a fun and unique way to celebrate and recognize their employees when they hit their 10 year service anniversary. Instead of giving them a trophy, plaque, watch or something else a bit ordinary, they create a personalized bobblehead of the employee. One copy is given to the employee, and the other put onto the bobblehead shelf, becoming a part of the company folklore.\nI hope these examples have not only made you smile, but have shown you practical ways that companies are bringing their personality and culture out in how they recognize their employees. I challenge you to do the same, to show appreciation based on your personality and culture.\nRecognition",

    "content": "Preventing shock waves - 5 tips for getting your communications \"right\"\nDebra Corey\nJul 15, 2021\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nJul 9, 2023\nI ran into a friend the other day who shared with me a communication their business had sent out to their workforce that had created shock waves. And like any shock wave, it had created disturbances that moved fast and furiously across the organization causing emotions such as fear, uncertainty and anger.\nAs I heard this story it reinforced what I had learned myself, often the hard way, about the importance of getting communication “right”.\nSo in my quest to “pay it forward”, here are five tips to help you get your communications “right”:\nTip 1: Start by defining your objectives\nA question I've always asked myself and now my clients is - what reaction, feeling and/or action do you want from your employees once the communication goes out?\nBy starting with an end in mind, and using this to define your objectives, your “why”, you can then move forward to develop your communication solidly based on what you are trying to achieve.\nTip 2: Don’t sugar coat or withhold the truth\nToo often we either sugar coat our communication, making the message or situation sound better than it is, or withhold the truth, not sharing the whole story. To explain the importance of this, let me ask you a question - how would you feel if a friend or family member did this to you? Would you trust them less, be angry, or both? That’s exactly what happens if you do this with your employees, as you’ll risk losing their trust and their engagement.\n“Lying to our staff, telling half-truths, withholding information and compulsive under-communication destroys trust in organizations. It creates an ‘us and them’ culture and sabotages any possibility of employee engagement. If you’re serious about employee engagement, you need to stop the lies and build trust instead” - taken from my book\nBuild it: The rebel playbook for employee engagement\nTip 3: Test it out\nIt’s always a good idea to test your communication with someone(s) who can provide an objective opinion\nbefore it is sent out\n. I know that this adds time, and it often means that you need to make additional changes, but it’s worth the time and effort as you can often prevent misunderstandings that may occur.\nAnother side of testing is to test it\nonce it has been sent out\nto identify if it is on track for achieving your objectives. Again, this takes time and often creates additional work, but it’s better to know if you’re off track and be able to do something about it, then to naively assume it is working.\nTip 4: Give your managers a heads up\nThe first people our employees go to answer their questions, especially after something is communicated, is their manager. Then why do we so often not give them a heads up, instead putting them in the uncomfortable position of having to explain and often defend a communication when they haven’t had time to digest and understand it themselves?\nFor this reason, I always encourage companies to go out to their managers first with the communication before it is sent out across the organization. And, if the message is either complex or critical, have a call or meeting with them beforehand to set them up for success with their teams.\nTip 5: Make room for questions and feedback\nThe final tip has to do with the concept of two-way communication, which is just as critical as the communication itself.\nIt’s important to find ways to make room for questions and feedback whenever you communicate to your workforce. Whether that’s by having this within your communication if you are doing it within your intranet, having Q&A sessions after it has been sent out, or whatever you think will work best based on the communication and your company culture.\nI hope you’ve found these tips helpful, and do keep them in mind as you communicate to your workforce, getting it right for them and for your business AND avoiding shock waves.\nIf you’d like to learn more about communication, check out a free workshop pack that you can find in the Free Resources tab of my website or in my\nbook\ntitled “Effective HR Communication: A framework for communicating with IMPACT”.\nTags:\nEmployee communication\nCommunication",

And why not, we need them to succeed to ensure we have a job, and to ensure we get a regular paycheck. But to an engaged employee, wanting their company to succeed is so much more. And that’s because they think and act in such a different way, in a way that can be the difference between their business succeeding and failing.\nWhen I talk about this to audiences, I share with them how I’ve seen this play out in the following two ways:\nEngaged employees take ownership\nA business will never succeed if decisions are made from the top down. Yes, the big decisions may need to be done in this way, but what about all of the thousands of other decisions that are made on a day-to-day basis?\nUnless, like in the movie “Multiplicity” where Michael Keaton created multiple versions of himself so he could be everywhere at the same time, we can’t do this, it just won’t work. And even if it did work, is that really what your business needs to succeed?\nIsn’t it better to have more people informed about what your business is trying to achieve, and then let them go out and help the business achieve it in their own unique way through owning the situation?\nAnd the added benefit is that according to a\nsurvey\nby Gallup, employees who use their strengths, skills and abilities at work are six times more engaged!\nAn example of this concept in action comes from a story I heard when visiting Zappos, a US online retailer. When talking to a member of the help desk team, she told me of how she delighted a customer by owning the situation.\nWhat happened was that a customer called to ask how she could return her bridesmaid dresses, as her fiance had cancelled the wedding a week before it was due to happen. Instead of just telling the customer the process to follow, she recognized the needs of the customer and did something about it by helping her return the dresses and then sending her a spa voucher with a handwritten note saying ‘I know you’re going through a hard time, so do something special for yourself’. How’s that for creating a positive customer experience? And it never would have happened if this engaged employee had not truly owned the situation.\nEngaged employees innovate\nThe other way that I’ve seen engaged employees directly impact the success of their company is through innovation. As we all know, innovation is something that is critical to the success of any business, and like my last point, it will never happen if we only rely on a few people in the organization to achieve it.\nMy first example which brings this to life comes from a company where I previously worked, Merlin Entertainments. The situation was that at our Legoland attraction an employee noticed the challenges that parents and children were having as they waited in the lines. We’ve all been there, anxious and impatient children, and parents struggling to entertain them.\nSo this engaged employee came up with the idea of putting big tables full of LEGO in a space in the middle of the line. Here, children could safely go and play while their parents could watch them and hold their place in the line. Fantastic idea, and one that combines both ownership and innovation.\nAnother example that combines ownership and innovation comes from Francesca Gina’s book titled “Rebel Talent”. She tells of a pastry chef at an Italian restaurant that dropped a lemon tart on the floor when delivering it to a customer. Instead of seeing this as a disaster, he saw it as an opportunity to innovate, and created a deconstructed lemon tart, which is now the best-selling dessert on the menu.\nSo next time you find yourself thinking about  ways to help your business succeed, start by asking yourself (and your business) – what can we do to create a more engaged workforce? For when you do this, ownership, innovation and all the other positives as a result of employee engagement will follow and work the trick!!\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "Why social connections are as important as eating veggies\nDebra Corey\nSep 19, 2020\n4 min read\nUpdated:\nApr 6, 2021\nConnecting your workforce is something that all companies have been focusing on throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. In fact, I have an entire whiteboard filled with examples of how companies from around the world are doing it in a variety of ways.\nBut have we ever stopped to ask ourselves why? Why are we doing it?\nMany would say that it’s to replace the ‘water cooler’ moments, which is absolutely true, but it’s so much more. In fact, social connections have been proven to improve physical health and psychological wellbeing, which means they’re right up there with eating your veggies, working out and getting a proper night’s sleep.\nAnd that’s because according to research social connections can:\nLower the rates of anxiety and depression\nIncrease self-esteem\nImprove trust and cooperation\nStrengthen our immune system\nLead to increase chance of longevity\nSo how do you improve social connections and benefit from these positive impacts? Here are six tips to help you as you continue to develop and roll out social connection programs:\nTip 1 – Start with why\nThe first question you should ask yourself before rolling out a program to drive social connections is ‘why’ – why does my business and people want and need these connections? Is it to achieve a business objective, e.g. complete a project, is it to improve cooperation between team members, or is it just to have a bit of fun? If you start by answering this question, you’ll have a better chance of having the social connections tick the box, and achieve your objectives.\nTip 2 – Don’t do it alone\nOver the years I’ve learned that some of ‘my’ best ideas are those that have come from others, which means that when it comes to coming up with ideas, I leverage the combined creativity of my entire organization. Whether it’s bringing in a committee to help you and/or conducting pulse surveys to ask your entire workforce for input, if you bring your employees into the process I promise you the results will be much better.\nTip 3 – Trial and error\nAnother thing I’ve learned over the years is the power of trial and error, especially when it comes to things like social connections. For example, one company I interviewed told me that at the start of the pandemic they sent every employee a jump rope, with the idea that they would do virtual jump rope sessions. What they found out was that employees actually didn’t want to jump with one another, so they quickly scrapped this idea and moved onto something else. So don’t get too precious about programs, if they work continue them, and if they don’t, move (or jump) on!\nTip 4 – Have something for everyone\nOften we create programs to meet the needs of our loudest employees, those that share ideas and/or shout the loudest. And while we certainly want to meet their needs, it’s important to hear all voices and design programs around the diverse needs of our entire workforce. For example, consider those that may not be comfortable with certain activities or competitions, and find ways where they do feel comfortable and thus, can achieve the benefits of social connections.\nTip 5 – Involve families\nDuring lockdown, many companies have invited family members into social connections for the first time. This has been beneficial in that it helps meet their social connection needs, encourages employees to participate when they may not have done so, and even improves employee engagement as family members are seeing the benefits of the employee working at the company.\nTip 6 – Have managers involved\nLast, and certainly not least, is to stress the important role that managers have when it comes to social connections. The more they can get involved with the connection activities, role modelling it to others, the better chance you have of your workforce engaging. Whether it’s leading an activity or merely being a participant, encourage them to have an active role in activities as well as 1:1 social connections with their team. And if they don’t believe it’s important . . . . share with them the benefits I listed at the start of this blog.\nAnd in case you’ve run out of ideas for social connections, let me end with a list of 21 virtual activities from my whiteboard:\nExercise Class\nPub Quiz\nHappy Hour\nMeditation Class\nTalent Competition\nDance Party\nCooking Class\nCome Dine with Me\nMurder Mystery Party\nCocktail Making Class\nBake Off\nBook Club\nArt Class\nGuess the Baby Picture\nRunning/walking Club\nWine Tasting Class\nPet Talent Competition\nParent’s Club\nChess Lessons\nKid’s Coloring Competition\nChildren’s Storytelling\nAbout the author:\nDebra Corey is a highly experienced and award-winning HR leader, world-class speaker, three-time author, consultant, and was named one of the top 101 global employee engagement influencers. She’s had a varied career, working for global companies such as Gap Inc., Merlin Entertainments and Reward Gateway, where she’s developed and delivered HR strategies in a rebellious way, pushing the boundaries and challenging the status quo to truly drive employee engagement.\nIn 2019 Debra founded her own company, DebCo HR, where as Chief Pay It Forward Solutions Officer she’s inspiring and helping others to bring out their inner rebel and drive business change.\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "How I overcame a fear . . . well, working on it!\nDebra Corey\nNov 3, 2017\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nDec 19, 2020\nWe all have fears, some are small and uneventful, and others are bigger, significantly holding us back.  I’m not sure where you would put my fear, but I put it in the significant category, as it prevents me from doing something I love – walking my dogs!\nLet me start from the beginning, I have two lovely labrador rescue dogs named Poppy and Java (the two in the front of this picture not sitting).  They were two and three when we rescued them, so came with some habits which have been impossible to rid them of.  Two of these habits are running up to ‘say hello’ to every dog they see and to chase after every cat, squirrel or leaf blowing in the wind.\nThe good news is that the only part of the walk that I’m fearful of is the 5 minutes each way when I’m walking to and from the fields.  It’s here that if they got off their leads they could run into the road and possibly get hurt.  If you’re a pet owner, I’m sure you can imagine the fear this causes me.\nYou’re probably thinking, no biggie, just keep them on leads until you get to the fields.  Which is exactly what I do, but what I failed to tell you is that I am all of 5’0” tall, so even on leads, it’s almost impossible for me to hold them back.  I’ve tried, and my entire village has watched in amusement and/or terror as I’ve been pulled off my feet trying to hold on to them!\nThe way I normally get around this is to walk with my dog-walking buddies Sue or Lynn, but they were both on vacation this week.  So I could either skip the daily walks or be brave and overcome my fears, which, as you can hopefully see, were substantiated fears.\nWhat did I do, I went for it, and walked my dogs ALONE!\nThe good news is that both my dogs and I have survived the walks, and in fact, we’ve even enjoyed them.  Here’s what I learned, which I wanted to share to help you overcome any fears you may have:\nDon’t feel you have to jump in with both feet\nFor my first walk alone I had my daughter walk next to me until I got to the fields.  This gave me the confidence that if I had a problem I could count on her to help me.  She was then on call to help me should I need it on the way back, which I didn’t need as I decided to be brave and do it alone.\nFocus on your strengths\nOne of the reasons I decided I could do this was because of a talk I heard last week by Daniel Pink.  He spoke about how important it is to focus on your strengths and not to let your weaknesses hold you back.  So I focused and thought about my strengths – I’m smart enough to get out of a situation and brave and nice enough to ask for help from a stranger if I need it.  By focusing on these, and not letting my mind focus on my weakness of not being very strong, I was able to overcome my fear – thanks Daniel!\nHave a plan B\nHave you ever seen a superhero or spy who is able to see two, three or more steps into the future.  Well I thought like a superhero, and looked into the future by creating my plan B.  If I see another dog coming at me here, I’ll go there, if I see a cat, I’ll start playing with them and get their attention off of the cat.  By having a plan B, I felt I was in control of the situation, making my fears and the situation less terrifying.\nIn ending, let me tell you that I had an unexpected benefit from this situation, which was thinking time.  Since I normally walk with someone else I don’t have time to think as we’re always chatting.  Here I was in a beautiful field in the countryside, with my dogs running around having a fabulous time, and I could think.  In fact, that’s where I came up with the idea of writing this blog.\nSo my advice is to go out there and overcome your fears.  As with me, it will be a work in progress, but that doesn’t matter as long as you’re taking that first step.  Or in my case, taking that first walk with your dogs!\nEmployee Engagement",

    "content": "5 recognition lessons from a cooking competition\nDebra Corey\nSep 8, 2022\n5 min read\nUpdated:\nSep 9, 2022\nIn my latest book,\nAppreciate it! The Playbook for Employee Recognition\n, I share what I call the “Four Golden Rules of Recognition.” The second of these has to do with the concept of making recognition unified and inclusive, something key to recognition strategies, as well as our overall people strategies.\nThis is an area where much work still needs to be done. Too often, we put limits on who can be recognized, e.g. only one person can win employee of the month, or only six people can win employee of the year, etc, which can have negative consequences.\nWe need to practice “equal opportunity” recognition, looking at recognition through an inclusion lens, making sure that everyone has an equal opportunity to be noticed, appreciated and recognized.\nHere are a five of the negative consequences that I share in my book:\n1.  Feelings of exclusion\n– By limiting the number of people who can be recognized it often leads to others feeling excluded, creating the “haves” and “have nots.” This goes against the grain of a unified and inclusive approach to recognition, putting up barriers and closing the door on recognition for many of your hard-working employees.\n2.  Negative reactions\n– It can also lead to negative reactions from those not winning the recognition awards, or as I call them, the “eye-rollers.” This happens when the names are called out and people roll their eyes and say things to themselves or to others like, “what did they do to win, I did the exact same thing as them,” or “I can’t believe they won again, they’re such a favorite,” or even “I give up, why work so hard if I’m never recognized!”\n3.  Creates more losers than winners\n– Next, this can lead to your employees feeling like either a winner or a loser, with the few, your top 5-10% of employees feeling like winners and the remaining 90-95% of employees feeling like losers.\n4.  Leaves out your “glue people”\n– Limiting recognitions can also leave out what Eric Hutcherson, Chief People & Inclusion Officer at Universal Group, calls his “glue people.” He explained that when he was at the National Basketball Association they had their stars and their glue people, who were those that held the team together. He went on to say that if we only recognized our stars, or in basketball terms, our scorers, we were completely ignoring those that make the assists or grab the rebounds or play great defense. These people, your glue people, are the ones that day after day show up and contribute to the success of your company, and if you don’t recognize them will walk away and leave your star players standing alone on the “court.”\n\"I believe the world is big enough that everyone can have success, and that you don't have to lose in order for me to win. We can all coexist, and all have an equal opportunity to be recognized.\"\n5.  Reduces the power of recognition\n– Finally, with fewer people being recognized it will naturally lead to fewer recognition moments which will directly impact the overall power and benefits of recognition. It’s simple math!\nSo what can we do to recognize those that truly and genuinely excel and contribute at a higher level than others? How can we have winners without making everyone else feel defeated, zapped of their drive and engagement, and feeling like losers? This was a question I racked my brain trying to figure out how best to answer until I was watching\nMasterChef Australia\n, a show where amateur chefs battle it out week after week to be crowned the champion. And it came to me, yes they only have one winner at the end of the season, but as contestants face elimination tests and one by one leave the show as losers, they actually leave as winners. Here’s five ways that they get it right:\n1.  There are multiple opportunities to be a winner\n– Throughout the series, there are many opportunities to celebrate contestant successes and to feel like winners, such as making it to the next level or winning individual cooking competitions. In fact, throughout the series, most contestants at one point in time have this winning feeling.\nRecognition tip:\nLook for opportunities to recognize your employees in a multitude of ways so that everyone has the opportunity to feel appreciated for their contributions.\n2.  There are many ways to be a winner\n– One reason why there are so many winners throughout the series is that there are multiple ways to win. Whether it’s a team challenge, a skills test or an invention test, they don’t just compete in one way throughout the series. This allows contestants with different skills to have the opportunity to excel and win.\nRecognition tip:\nCreate multiple recognition plans within your overall program so that there are more opportunities to be recognized.\n3.  They have mini-winners\n– For each cooking challenge, they don’t just call out the name of the one winner but they call out and bring forward the top three winners of the challenge. By doing this, they're creating mini-winners, who feel like they’ve achieved something for being called forward and for having positive words being said about their dish, celebrating their successes.\nRecognition tip:\nCelebrate not just recognition award winners, but runner-ups and highly commended.\n4.  There are constant learning moments\n– Throughout every challenge, contestants are given feedback from the judges, positive and negative, which helps them learn and grow as chefs. One by one as they leave the show they consistently say the same thing, which is to thank the judges for such an amazing learning experience. In the last episode I watched, the contestant said, “I feel confident in my abilities, like I can fly out the door,\" which sounds like a winner and not a loser to me!\nRecognition tip:\nTeach your employees how to give meaningful recognition so that recognition provides both appreciation and learning moments.\n5.  They celebrate when they are eliminated\n– Although no one likes to lose and have to leave the show, they do this with such genuine respect and admiration, focusing on what they have done and not the fact that they have lost. So much so, that the final thing shared about the contestant in an episode is what they’ve done next to follow their cooking dream, whether that’s an apprenticeship, a food blog or even if they’ve opened up their own line of sauces. This is how they’ve taken what they’ve learned to move forward as a winner – and not a loser.\nI encourage you to challenge your recognition strategy and program, taking a step back and evaluating whether it's driving inclusion and equity or driving a wedge in it. And if you need inspiration to change it, watch a few episodes of\nMasterChef Australia\n, read my book, or find other ways so that you can ultimately make these important changes.\nRecognition",

    "content": "8 tips for getting your recognition rewards \"right\"\nDebra Corey\nMar 10, 2023\n5 min read\nOne of the most challenging (and daunting) parts of designing a recognition program is determining the rewards. Get it right, and you deliver what I call the “appreciation feeling,” get it wrong and . . . . well let’s just say that it’s not the outcome your people and business deserve and need!\nOver the years I’ve gotten it both right and wrong, so to help you learn from my mistakes and embrace my successes, let me share with you eight tips:\n1. Make it meaningful\nT\nhe first thing to think about is how your rewards can be meaningful, e.g. relevant, important and valuable to the recipient(s). It might seem obvious, of course we want them to be meaningful, but too often companies fail to understand their people and give out awards that lack meaning and thus impact.\nAlways, always, always, start by listening to and understanding what matters and is meaningful to your employees, and you’ll have a better chance of your rewards being right for them.\nFor example, at many companies handing out certificates to recognize employees just doesn’t work, with employees not feeling appreciated by this act as it could be deemed a bit old-fashioned. However, at the University of Lincoln, a key part of one of their recognition plans is for their vice-chancellor to present recognition recipients with a certificate during their annual awards ceremony. This has meaning because it is something they do with their students to symbolize their achievements and contributions and thus it delivers the same meaning and impact to their staff. What works for one company or organization might not work for another, which is why it’s important to get feedback from your employees from the start.\n2. Connect it to the contribution and impact\nBuild a connection and relationship between the reward you give (or don’t give) and the\ncontribution and impact\nof the actions and behaviors.\nFor example, I remember a time when a business partner wanted to give a member of my team $1,000 for the support they had given them during the annual pay review process. By doing this there would have been a disconnect between their actions and the reward, as this was part of their job and thus their efforts and the impact were not above and beyond what was expected. By giving this reward it would have not only sent the wrong message to the employee (and the rest of my team), but it could have caused problems in the future as they would have expected similar rewards for similar actions going forward.\n3. Consider the relationships between recognition plans\nAsk yourself, how do rewards for one recognition plan compare to rewards for another one? These relationships are based on the impact of the actions and behaviors, so it’s important to look at the relative step and relationship from one plan to another.\nFor example, at one company when we looked at the relationships we saw a big jump from one recognition plan to another, so we doubled the reward. However, at the next level plan, we saw a smaller jump, so the reward was only slightly higher. The key here is to understand, map out and then address these “jumps” as you determine your rewards.\n4. Consider the relationships to other reward programs\nThe other relationship to consider as you develop your recognition rewards is in respect to your other elements of reward, e.g. pay, bonuses, incentives. The reason I suggest reviewing this is that often I’ve seen companies where the recognition reward is the same if not more than an annual bonus award. In these situations, you need to ask yourself – is the level of contribution for both the same? Often the answer is no, as an annual bonus is for work achieved throughout the year, where a recognition reward is often for a shorter time frame and effort. Bottom line, review them together to ensure they connect, align and fit together into a cohesive total rewards package.\n5. Consider offering choice\nOver the years, more and more companies are offering their employees choice when they receive their recognition awards. The benefits of this is that it lets them decide what will make them feel appreciated, respecting their individual preferences and the overall diversity of your workforce.\nA common way to do this is with gift cards, vouchers and points through an online recognition platform. This lets your employees decide when and how they want to use them, putting decision-making in their hands. One of my favorite stories about a point system was shared with me by one of my employees. He explained that he had saved up points so he could use them to buy a new pair of shoes, and that every time he wore them they reminded him of all of the people who had recognized him. Love it!\n6. Find a balance\nBesides choice, another key element of effective recognition programs is balance, especially when there’s so much diversity in our workforce and in the work that is being done. And when it comes to recognition rewards, this is absolutely key, trying to strike that perfect balance between financial and non-financial rewards and formal and informal recognition.\n7. Do it your own way\nThe next thing to ask yourself is, how can you design recognition rewards in your unique way? In interviewing companies for my books I have collected some great example, here are a few to help and inspire you:\nT-shirts\n– At Nav, a U.S. FinTech company, they give out t-shirts that display the value they are being recognized for. As Levi King, CEO & Co-Founder explained to me, “We’re not a workplace of plaques and certificates, we are t-shirt kind of people.”\nMiniature wagon\n– At Radio Flyer, an American toy company best known for their popular red toy wagon, they give out golden wagons, which are miniature replicas of one of their products, as a way to recognize one another for living their company values. The wagons are passed from one employee to another each month along with a handwritten “you are awesome” note. The recipient of the wagon adds their initials on the bottom of the wagon before passing it onto the next person.\nGolden toilet\n– At Venables Bell & Partner, a U.S. marketing agency, they have a bit of fun with their annual awards, creating ones that are fun and quirky, aligning with their culture. One example is their golden toilet award that is given to the employee who “takes care of shit gracefully and with class,” explained Paul Venables, Founder & CEO, with the winner receiving a full-size golden toilet.\nName a star\n–\nAt Virgin Group, the umbrella group for Virgin businesses, all employees who are recognized as part of their group “Star of the Year” program have a star named after them. This not only creates a lasting memory, but truly makes them feel like a star.\n8. Remember, it’s not about the money!\nLast, but certainly not least, is to make the point that it is never, ever, ever all about the money when it comes to deciding your recognition reward. Keep in mind that the first reward is the reward of being recognized, and then if it’s right, the second reward can have a financial value.\nI hope you’ve found these eight tips helpful in determining the “right” rewards to deliver the appreciation feeling at your company.

    "content": "From Worst to First: How Wurzak Hotel Group Transformed Their Culture and Became an Employer of Choice\nDebra Corey\nJan 26\n3 min read\nUpdated:\nApr 12\nThe Wurzak Hotel Group has been on an incredible journey, one that took them from being a company with one of the lowest Glassdoor ratings (2.2) to becoming an Employer of Choice with a remarkable 4.2 rating. This transformation wasn’t by chance - it was the result of intentionality, creativity, and commitment to building a culture that team members could thrive in.\nAt the heart of this transformation was James Ferguson, who transitioned from being a General Manager at one of their hotels to leading culture efforts across the company. While he knew how to build a strong culture at one property, scaling that success across 10 hotels presented an entirely new challenge. This role - a first for the company - was created out of necessity, recognizing that culture would be a driving force for success.\nJames took on the challenge with enthusiasm, developing a plan built on eight foundational pillars that would drive the company’s culture forward. But having pillars alone wasn’t enough - they needed a plan to bring them to life and into action. Here’s how they did this, using a three-phase approach: Awareness, Education, and Activation.\nPhase 1: Awareness – Defining the Pillars\nWhen James stepped into the role, the pillars existed, but they had no definitions. The first step was to define what each pillar meant, creating a shared understanding across the organization.\nTo make these pillars visible, they created large posters with the pillars and their matching icons, placing them in the back-of-house areas at each hotel. They intentionally avoided overcomplicating the messaging, opting instead to build awareness through simplicity and consistency. The goal was clear - to move the pillars beyond abstract conversations and transform them into a visible, tangible part of the workplace, fully integrated and living and breathing within the organization.\nWurzak Hotel Group's Values\nPhase 2: Education – Bringing the Pillars to Life\nAwareness was just the start. Next came education - helping team members understand how the pillars applied to their day-to-day work. They did this by launching the ‘Pillars with Purpose Plan,’ a fun and experiential curriculum of huddle exercises designed to energize teams. These ten minute micro-learning sessions focused on a single pillar each day, guiding team members to Define, Discover, Develop, and Deploy it in action.\n“This helped take what was just a picture on the wall and turn it into a conversation and an education,” James shared. “It allowed people to better understand how the pillars connected to our day-to-day work.”\nPhase 3: Activation – Turning Words into Actions\nThe final phase was all about activation, ensuring the pillars weren’t just words on a wall but became part of the company’s DNA. One standout program was ‘Wurzak WOW,’ an on-the-spot recognition program celebrating team members for embodying the pillars. Leaders could hand out WOW cards by circling the specific pillar a team member had exemplified, explaining what caught their eye and why, and then the team member would place the WOW bucks in a recognition box.\nEvery Friday - dubbed ‘Fri-YAY’ - a winner was randomly selected and celebrated at each hotel, with names and stories shared in newsletters, luncheons, and quarterly business reviews. “It’s also a great way to get leaders out of their offices, actively looking for and recognizing the great work happening across our hotels,” James noted.\nWurzak Hotel Group WOW Program\nAnother example of an activation tool was the introduction of the ‘W’ hand symbol. Inspired by sports teams who use symbols as their rallying cry, James implemented this simple gesture to build community and unity across Wurzak’s team members. “It’s really caught on,” he said. “In fact, in every team photo, you’ll see people proudly throwing up the ‘W.’”\nI absolutely loved the idea of the ‘W’! So much so, that when I had the honor of presenting Wurzak with the Culture Pioneer Brand Award, I couldn’t resist asking everyone in the audience to flash the iconic ‘W’. It was a powerful moment to celebrate not just this simple yet impactful symbol, but also the tremendous work and achievements of the Wurzak team.

    "content": "7 tips for communicating through challenging times\nDebra Corey\nApr 7, 2020\n5 min read\nUpdated:\nFeb 9, 2021\nI remember my first tornado, sitting alone in a closet in my apartment in Florida feeling scared, feeling alone and feeling disconnected. All I wanted was a connection, something or someone to tell me what was going on, that I was not alone, and that everything was going to be OK.\nThe good news is that the tornado never came. The bad news is that since the internet, mobile phones and even cordless phones had not yet been invented (yes there was a world before these), I sat in that darn closet all night long feeling scared and disconnected from the world, worrying and wondering what was going on and when and how it would all end.\nI share this story because we’re all going through something as, if not more, scary and unpredictable as a tornado with the coronavirus. But the good news is that we now have technology as a way to communicate to our workforce, helping them feel informed and helping them feel connected.\nBut technology cannot do it alone, for if communication is to make our workforce feel informed and connected it needs to be done in a meaningful and effective way. So let me share with you seven tips on how you can do this in these challenging times:\n1. Start with your objective - the ‘why’\nLet’s start with your communication objectives, the ‘why’. I suggest that before jumping in to create your communication messages, you pause for a moment and map out your objectives. Ask yourself why am I sending out this message, answering these two important questions:\nWhat do I want and need my employees to know?\nWhat do I want and need my employees to feel?\nBy answering these questions first, you’ll set your message up for success, ensuring it has the focus it requires to meet your objectives.\n2. Be open, honest and transparent\nThe absolute starting point and the absolute key to effective communication is to be open, honest and transparent. Without this, you create mistrust and disengagement, and you fuel fear and uncertainty. And because of this, if there was ever a time to remove the cloak of secrecy in what you tell your employees it is now, for hiding information, telling lies or half truths will only make a bad situation even worse than it is already.\nSo start and end with the truth, giving your employees enough information to feel in the know, bringing them into your circle of trust and helping you and them survive in these challenging times.\n3. Keep your messages short\nOnce you’ve made your commitment to being open, honest and transparent,  the key is to present the information and messages in the most effective way. The first tip has to do with the length of the messages, for let’s face it, in good times our employees don’t have much of an attention span when it comes to communications. In fact, I read an article that said that the average human attention span has reduced from 12 seconds to 8 seconds over the years, ouch!\nAnd in these challenging times our attention span has reduced even more, with additional distractions fighting for our attention. For that reason, it’s important to understand and respect this - communicating in a short and straightforward way.\nChallenge yourself with every word and every sentence, asking yourself if they are really necessary, or if it will just lose the precious attention of your workforce. Focus on giving your employees exactly and entirely what they need.\n4. Repeat key messages\nAnother communications challenge is retention, for according to the ‘forgetting curve’ on average\nwe forget 50 percent of the information in an hour, 70 percent in 24 hours and 90 percent in a week\n. Again, ouch!\nOne way to overcome these odds is to repeat your key messages, ensuring that some if not all of them will stick. Here are 2 tips to help with this:\nUse different formats to create interesting  and lasting memories is to mix up the messaging by using different formats. For example, one time it could be a short bullet message, another time a blog, another time stories, and another time a video.\nCreate a coordinated approach when repeating your messages. Map out how and when messages will be sent, taking the time to analyse what works and what doesn’t, and adapting your approach so that messages work together and support you in achieving your objectives.\n5. Create engaging messages\nAnother way to overcome the retention challenge is to make your communications engaging, creating interest and again ‘stickiness’ so that your workforce will want to read it and will more easily retain it.\nTo bring this point to life, let me refer to a few things I’ve done in this blog to try to get you to read it (you are still reading it, right?). The first was that I shared a story to pull you in, second was that I broke it up with short and simple tips/points, and third I added a bit of humour with some statistics and informal comments. Bottom line, you decide what is engaging based on your workforce and your culture.\n6. Communicate from the top\nLet’s now move onto the who, so who should the communications come from? If there was ever a time we needed our CEO to step up when it comes to communications, it’s now. Your workforce needs to hear from the top, from your CEO, hearing directly from them how the business is doing (good and bad) and what the business is doing to support them.\nAnd if they don’t feel comfortable with this, now is the time to be a ‘rebel’ as I write and talk about, being brave and bold to help them understand that without them the communication will not be effective. And without communication being effective, your people and your business will suffer.\n7. Find ways to communicate in many directions\nLast but not least, now is the time that you drive and support communication in many directions. So far I’ve spoken about communicating to your workforce, so communicating upwards, but it’s just as important that you facilitate communication in these two other  directions:\nDownwards\n- It’s so important to give your employees a voice, letting them be heard on an ongoing and continuous basis, and letting them know that the business continues to care about them. For this reason we need to be having a constant dialogue with our workforce, allowing them to share their thoughts and to ask their questions. Forget about annual employee engagement surveys, you should be formally and/or informally asking employees for their thoughts and providing ways for them to speak up, and for you to take action.\nCircular\n- It’s also important to have communication between your workforce, using this to keep your culture and community alive and your workforce engaged. Technology is great for setting up channels and communities where employees can easily and freely share tips, stories and even silly pictures to help everyone cope and remain positive and productive.\nLet me end with a quote from author Anne Morrow Lindbergh,\n“Good communication is just as stimulating as black coffee, and just as hard to sleep after.”\nLet’s make our communication so effective that our employees don’t need coffee to keep them alert, informed, connected, engaged and productive!\nThis blog was first published in\nHR Zone\n.\nCommunication",
